In this talk, I examine how functional programming can contribute to building systems that are more resilient, predictable and reproducible in the face of huge amounts of input data (such as from satellites and ground sensing) that demands precise access control (or else poachers and malicious actors go straight to the source) and requires interactive exploration from non-CS-experts at different levels of the software stack (to do climate science). I will also highlight how our ongoing cross-disciplinary research is having a real impact on conservation projects that are sorely underserved by current systems/PL infrastructure, and also how we went about forging these links.\n\n\nLet's keep in touch!

              "description": "✨This talk was recorded at Code BEAM America 2024, a conference by Code Sync https://codebeamamerica.com ✨\n\nIn this talk we will explore the fundamentals behind the magic of some of the debugging tools in Elixir and their benefits to debug borderline conditions and find hard to reproduce bugs in live Erlang systems 🔮🪄\n\nElixir has a very powerful set of debugging tools not everyone is aware of. They bring the community benefits inherited from the need to debug borderline conditions and find hard to reproduce bugs in live Erlang systems. In this talk, we'll explore the foundations behind Elixir wrappers like Rexbug, using examples to explain the fundamentals which give us all this magic.\n\n\nLet's stay in touch!

            "description": "✨This talk was recorded at Code BEAM Europe 2023. If you're curious about our upcoming event, check https://codebeameurope.com  ✨\n\nAbstract:\n\nElixir's umbrella projects have long been a go-to choice for structuring applications. While they provide a great foundation for modular code organisation, they still fall short when it comes to fully embracing the benefits of a microservices architecture.\n \n In my talk, I will unveil a strategy for transforming umbrella monoliths into scalable microservices. The best part? This approach requires little effort and leverages the built-in, battle-tested mechanisms provided by Erlang and Elixir.\n\n I will guide you through a step-by-step guide, demonstrating how to transition from an umbrella monolith to a distributed microservices architecture – with practical code examples.\n \n\n My presentation slides: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/17xaMVh-4uYtfok6qFuBAf0K8SA-BFGFt2sjeVTcdFxc/edit?usp=sharing\n\nLet's keep in touch!

              "description": "✨This talk was recorded at Code BEAM Europe 2023. If you're curious about our upcoming event, check https://codebeameurope.com  ✨\n\nAbstract:\n\nElixir's umbrella projects have long been a go-to choice for structuring applications. While they provide a great foundation for modular code organisation, they still fall short when it comes to fully embracing the benefits of a microservices architecture.\n \n In my talk, I will unveil a strategy for transforming umbrella monoliths into scalable microservices. The best part? This approach requires little effort and leverages the built-in, battle-tested mechanisms provided by Erlang and Elixir.\n\n I will guide you through a step-by-step guide, demonstrating how to transition from an umbrella monolith to a distributed microservices architecture – with practical code examples.\n \n\n My presentation slides: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/17xaMVh-4uYtfok6qFuBAf0K8SA-BFGFt2sjeVTcdFxc/edit?usp=sharing\n\nLet's keep in touch!

I discuss how imortant it is to ensure that your communications are delivered, whether to your clients from you, to you from your clients, or even from your automated systems like authentication, support tools, monitoring systems and so much more.  We discuss the pros and cons of self hosting email in 2024 and beyond, as well as the benefits of using a service like Purely Mail. As always, my goal is to help us get our MSP, or any other business up and running with as little up front cost as we can.\n\nI have no affiliation to Purely Mail, and the link below is just to their main site.  I have no stake in you using Purely or any other solution. \n\nI do have affiliate links for Hover (which I use in this video for my domain name and DNS services.  If you use it for your domain registration, I'll receive a credit from Hover.

Make it worth the trip.\" \n\nSo, what road(s) are you going to take? And what skills are you going to need to get there?\n\nBut when the skills that were once in demand are no longer enough, it's critical that you adapt to the new landscape. But how do you know what you need for the future?\n\nThis year, the Scrum Alliance and Business Agility Institute have teamed up to investigate the question \"Which Skills Are Most in Demand Today?\". During this workshop, we'll explore the findings of that research and, most importantly, what it means for you; from career mosaics and portfolio careers to the next evolution of coaching skills.\n\nThere's no question that agile has become a mainstay in the world of work. In technology and product teams, it has become an established way of working in millions of organizations. But we've also seen a year with an unprecedented number of layoffs of agile roles in particular.\n\nSo what does this mean for those who have developed themselves as agilists? For individuals, agile-related skills and experience have become a requirement for many careers. However on their own, it's becoming clear taht these skills are simply not enough. Fewer organizations are recruiting agile specialists (such as coaches), instead looking for individuals who can bring agile acumen and related skills to every role.\n\nThis webinar is for everyone mapping out their future - just remember to do it in pencil.",

Let's put in all the things.\n---\n\nBen Deane\n\nBen has been programming in C++ for this whole millennium. He spent just over 20 years in the games industry working for companies like EA and Blizzard; many of the games he worked on used to be fondly remembered but now he’s accepted that they are probably mostly forgotten. After getting more interested in modern C++, in the teens he started giving internal company talks and then talks at various conferences, spreading ideas about types, algorithms and declarative and functional techniques.\n\nIn 2018 he left the games industry and worked in finance for a short spell, writing high-frequency trading platforms using the most modern C++ that compilers could support. Now he is a Principal Engineer at Intel where he puts monads inside your CPU.\n---\n\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com\nYouTube Channel Managed by Digital Medium Ltd: https://events.digital-medium.co.uk\n---\n\nRegistration for CppCon: https://cppcon.org/registration/\n\n#cppcon #cppprogramming #cpp #lambda",

Let's put in all the things.\n---\n\nBen Deane\n\nBen has been programming in C++ for this whole millennium. He spent just over 20 years in the games industry working for companies like EA and Blizzard; many of the games he worked on used to be fondly remembered but now he’s accepted that they are probably mostly forgotten. After getting more interested in modern C++, in the teens he started giving internal company talks and then talks at various conferences, spreading ideas about types, algorithms and declarative and functional techniques.\n\nIn 2018 he left the games industry and worked in finance for a short spell, writing high-frequency trading platforms using the most modern C++ that compilers could support. Now he is a Principal Engineer at Intel where he puts monads inside your CPU.\n---\n\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com\nYouTube Channel Managed by Digital Medium Ltd: https://events.digital-medium.co.uk\n---\n\nRegistration for CppCon: https://cppcon.org/registration/\n\n#cppcon #cppprogramming #cpp #lambda"

I'll present what we did wrong at first, how we corrected it and the performance we can achieve for our particular application. I'll also briefly mention ways we can further improve our design. \n---\n\nPaul Tsouchlos\n\nI'm a C++ dev that enjoys coding outside work and writing open source libraries and applications.

            "description": "This seminar was hosted by Microsoft Research Africa, Nairobi together with the Microsoft AI for Good team in May 2024.\n\nUser-generated content (UGC), e.g. social media posts written in \"Internet language\", presents a lot of lexical variations and deviates from standard language. As a result, NLP models which were mostly trained on standard texts have been known to perform poorly on UGC, and sentence embedding models like LASER are no exception. \n\nIn this talk, we focus on the robustness of LASER to UGC data. We evaluate this robustness by LASER’s ability to represent non-standard sentences and their standard counterparts close to each other in the embedding space. Inspired by previous works extending LASER to other languages and modalities, we propose RoLASER, a robust English encoder trained using a teacher-student approach to reduce the distances between the representations of standard and UGC sentences. We also use data augmentation to generate synthetic UGC-like training data. \n\nWe show that RoLASER significantly improves LASER’s robustness to both natural and artificial UGC data by achieving up to 2× and 11× better alignment scores. We also perform a fine-grained analysis on artificial UGC data and find that our model greatly outperforms LASER on its most challenging UGC phenomena such as keyboard typos and social media abbreviations. Evaluation on downstream tasks shows that RoLASER performs comparably to or better than LASER on standard data, while consistently outperforming it on UGC data.\n\nSpeaker: Lydia Nishimwe\n\nLearn more about Microsoft Research Lab – Africa, Nairobi: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-lab-africa-nairobi/seminars/",

            "description": "Bill Jelen, Mr. Excel, recently posted a video requesting input on ways to retrieve specific data while hiding sensitive data.\n\nThe challenge: how can you use a person's last initial and the last-4 of their social security number to retrieve relevant details. HOWEVER! The full social security number should be available but not easily revealed.\n\nIn this video I use HSTACK, Power Query, Dynamic Arrays, LEFT and RIGHT to achieve this. But, rather than use formulas, I use simpler Excel features and focus on a process that imports the relevant data into the workbook where the lookups will be performed.\n\nUsing 2 workbooks, adds some friction to help separate the fully sensitive data and the daily use data.\n\n#ExcelChallenge #ImportData #PowerQueryTutorial\n\nFor a list of my Excel courses at Lynda/LinkedIn:\n\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/learning/instructors/oz-du-soleil\n\nThere are courses on Power Query, Good spreadsheet habits, and a weekly Excel challenge that comes out every Friday.\n\nWebsite: http://ozdusoleil.com\n\nMy book: Guerrilla Data Analysis 3rd Edition\nhttps://www.mrexcel.com/products/guerrilla-data-analysis-3rd-edition/\n\nMy old blog: http://datascopic.net/blog-2-2",

              "description": "Bill Jelen, Mr. Excel, recently posted a video requesting input on ways to retrieve specific data while hiding sensitive data.\n\nThe challenge: how can you use a person's last initial and the last-4 of their social security number to retrieve relevant details. HOWEVER! The full social security number should be available but not easily revealed.\n\nIn this video I use HSTACK, Power Query, Dynamic Arrays, LEFT and RIGHT to achieve this. But, rather than use formulas, I use simpler Excel features and focus on a process that imports the relevant data into the workbook where the lookups will be performed.\n\nUsing 2 workbooks, adds some friction to help separate the fully sensitive data and the daily use data.\n\n#ExcelChallenge #ImportData #PowerQueryTutorial\n\nFor a list of my Excel courses at Lynda/LinkedIn:\n\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/learning/instructors/oz-du-soleil\n\nThere are courses on Power Query, Good spreadsheet habits, and a weekly Excel challenge that comes out every Friday.\n\nWebsite: http://ozdusoleil.com\n\nMy book: Guerrilla Data Analysis 3rd Edition\nhttps://www.mrexcel.com/products/guerrilla-data-analysis-3rd-edition/\n\nMy old blog: http://datascopic.net/blog-2-2"

In similar fashion to the popular \"State of Go\" talk I will begin by discussing all of the exciting new features and changes that have happened over the past year, since last FOSDEM. Following that I will go into a live demo showcasing how Delve can leverage Mozilla RR in order to perform deterministic debugging. This talk will begin by introducing users to the concept of deterministic debugging and the power that comes with it. Following that I will launch into a demo showcasing how to leverage this concept to debug an otherwise unpredictable highly concurrent program. Users will walk away with immediate practical knowledge they can begin applying in their day to day debugging.\nIt's been a year since last FOSDEM and a lot has changed with Delve! I will discuss all the new features and changes that have been implemented in the last year.\n\n\nFollowing the \"State of Delve\" introduction, I will dig into how Delve can be utilized to perform deterministic debugging. This style of debugging enables users to record the execution of their process and \"play it back\" in a deterministic fashion in order to more quickly and efficiently perform root cause analysis on a bug that may otherwise be difficult to reproduce or track down. This section of the talk will begin by introducing the concept of deterministic debugging and why it is so useful and powerful. Once everyone is familiar with the concept I will launch into a live demo showcasing how to leverage this debugging approach to track down and fix a bug which is hard to reproduce and happens only intermittently.\n\n\nAttendees will walk away with practical knowledge that they can begin applying to their debugging problems immediately.\n\nRoom: UB2.252A (Lameere)\nScheduled start: 2020-02-02 11:00:00",

It's written in C but can be used almost with any other language (we've successfully used it with JavaScript, LUA, Python and Rust). It's highly extensible (at compile time) and portable so it can be run on almost any embedded device. In this talk I'll introduce the architecture of the profiler, present it's advantages and limitations, show how can you instrument the code and demonstrate the profiler in action by running it with an example cross-language (Rust, C++ and Python) project.\n\nRoom: K.4.201\nScheduled start: 2020-02-02 09:05:00",

              "description": "by Marcin Kolny\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2020\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2020/K.4.201/debugging_hawktrace.webm\n\nHawkTracer is low-overhead instrumentation-based profiler built at Amazon Video for platforms with limited capabilities. It's written in C but can be used almost with any other language (we've successfully used it with JavaScript, LUA, Python and Rust). It's highly extensible (at compile time) and portable so it can be run on almost any embedded device. In this talk I'll introduce the architecture of the profiler, present it's advantages and limitations, show how can you instrument the code and demonstrate the profiler in action by running it with an example cross-language (Rust, C++ and Python) project.\n\nRoom: K.4.201\nScheduled start: 2020-02-02 09:05:00"

            "description": "Maggy: Asynchronous distributed hyperparameter optimization based on Apache Spark Asynchronous algorithms on a bulk-synchronous system\nby Moritz Meister\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2020\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2020/UB5.132/maggy.webm\n\nMaggy is an open-source framework built on Apache Spark, for asynchronous parallel execution of trials for machine learning experiments. In this talk, we will present our work to tackle search as a general purpose method efficiently with Maggy, focusing on hyperparameter optimization. We show that an asynchronous system enables state-of-the-art optimization algorithms and allows extensive early stopping in order to increase the number of trials that can be performed in a given period of time on a fixed amount of resources.\nIn \"The Bitter Lesson of AI\", Rich Sutton (father of reinforcement learning) claimed that general purpose methods (like search and learning) that scale with increased computation are the future of AI. Apache Spark is a general purpose framework for scaling out data processing with available compute, but there are challenges in making Sparks' bulk-synchronous execution mechanism work efficiently with search and (deep) learning.\nIn this talk, we will present our work on Maggy, an open-source framework to tackle search as a general purpose method efficiently on Spark. Spark can be used to deploy basic optimizers (grid search, random search, differential evolution) proposing combinations of hyperparameters (trials) that are run synchronously in parallel on executors. However, many such trials perform poorly, and a lot of CPU and hardware accelerator cycles are wasted on trials that could be stopped early, freeing up resources for other trials. What is needed is support for asynchronous mechanisms.\nMaggy is an asynchronous hyperparameter optimization framework built on Spark that is able to transparently schedule and manage hyperparameter trials, by allowing limited communication, thereby increasing resource utilization, and massively increasing the number of trials that can be performed in a given period of time on a fixed amount of resources. Maggy is also built to support parallel ablation studies and applies to black box optimization/search problems in general. We will report on the gains we have seen in reduced time to find good hyperparameters and improved utilization of GPU hardware. Finally, we will perform a live demo on a Jupyter notebook, showing how to integrate Maggy in existing PySpark applications.\n\nRoom: UB5.132\nScheduled start: 2020-02-02 09:30:00",

As projects and their requirements evolve, complexity creeps in. Excess complexity slows progress, frustrating us as we try to keep large chunks of a program in our heads just to understand what is happening.\n\nTo conquer complexity, we must refactor! In this talk, we'll investigate how to identify unnecessary complexity in our code base using cognitive complexity as a measure, how to approach refactoring complex code, and what tools are available to help us refactor.

As projects and their requirements evolve, complexity creeps in. Excess complexity slows progress, frustrating us as we try to keep large chunks of a program in our heads just to understand what is happening.\n\nTo conquer complexity, we must refactor! In this talk, we'll investigate how to identify unnecessary complexity in our code base using cognitive complexity as a measure, how to approach refactoring complex code, and what tools are available to help us refactor. We'll put it all into practice through a live example. By the end of the talk, you'll be excited to tackle that 1000-line monstrosity of a function in your own code base (you know the one)."

I mean, the whole world has been shifting application security left for about five years... especially in the wake of DevSecOps.\n\nBut have we? Have we really?\n\nLet's look at the data, however, from the language we use, the practices we recommend, the posts we make and the frameworks we share. We are still stuck in a world focused on \"secure code\" when in reality, the code itself is only part of the picture when protecting our data, systems and people.\n\nThis talk will examine why we focus on secure code and how we can move towards secure development. Laura will provide practical actions you can take throughout your SDLC, from initial ideas to ongoing systems maintenance and support that you can apply today, whether as an individual team member or across a more complex project.\n\nLet's say goodbye to our dreams of secure code and embrace the idea of secure systems development.",

I mean, the whole world has been shifting application security left for about five years... especially in the wake of DevSecOps.\n\nBut have we? Have we really?\n\nLet's look at the data, however, from the language we use, the practices we recommend, the posts we make and the frameworks we share. We are still stuck in a world focused on \"secure code\" when in reality, the code itself is only part of the picture when protecting our data, systems and people.\n\nThis talk will examine why we focus on secure code and how we can move towards secure development. Laura will provide practical actions you can take throughout your SDLC, from initial ideas to ongoing systems maintenance and support that you can apply today, whether as an individual team member or across a more complex project.\n\nLet's say goodbye to our dreams of secure code and embrace the idea of secure systems development."

CTO Justin Cormack says that’s why the company is developer-obsessed, not customer-obsessed: “We really wanted to focus on the fact that it's the developer who loves Docker. It's the developer who is going to be using Docker every day…”\n\nOver the past decade, Docker exploded in popularity as companies moved to cloud and adopted software containers as they did... but the company struggled as as a business and, five years ago, made massive changes: “When we restructured people were like, `Well, I kind of hope this works, but I doubt it will.`” \n\nWell, it’s working. Docker is now bigger than ever and growing.\nOn this episode of CRAFTED... Dan and Justin discuss developer productivity, how Docker continues to build new products to improve it, and why so many organizations are in an awkward phase, with too many responsibilities being put onto the developer.  Plus, Justin will share tips for developers on how they can better communicate their needs. And what CFO-types can do in return: “the one thing they can do is actually listen to the developers!”\n***\nCRAFTED. is brought to you in partnership with Docker, which helps developers build, share, run and verify applications anywhere – without environment confirmation or management.

Plus, Justin will share tips for developers on how they can better communicate their needs. And what CFO-types can do in return: “the one thing they can do is actually listen to the developers!”\n***\nCRAFTED. is brought to you in partnership with Docker, which helps developers build, share, run and verify applications anywhere – without environment confirmation or management. More than 20 million developers worldwide use Docker's suite of development tools, services, and automations to accelerate the delivery of secure applications.

              "description": "When Docker restructured, we returned to our roots: super-serving developers. CTO Justin Cormack says that’s why the company is developer-obsessed, not customer-obsessed: “We really wanted to focus on the fact that it's the developer who loves Docker. It's the developer who is going to be using Docker every day…”\n\nOver the past decade, Docker exploded in popularity as companies moved to cloud and adopted software containers as they did... but the company struggled as as a business and, five years ago, made massive changes: “When we restructured people were like, `Well, I kind of hope this works, but I doubt it will.`” \n\nWell, it’s working. Docker is now bigger than ever and growing.\nOn this episode of CRAFTED... Dan and Justin discuss developer productivity, how Docker continues to build new products to improve it, and why so many organizations are in an awkward phase, with too many responsibilities being put onto the developer.  Plus, Justin will share tips for developers on how they can better communicate their needs. And what CFO-types can do in return: “the one thing they can do is actually listen to the developers!”\n***\nCRAFTED. is brought to you in partnership with Docker, which helps developers build, share, run and verify applications anywhere – without environment confirmation or management.

On this episode of CRAFTED., recorded live on the “Next” stage at SXSW, we discuss what investors look for in these new companies and how they separate what’s real — and what’s near-term — from what’s hype. \n\nOn stage with host Dan Blumberg are:\nAmy Kruse, General Partner & Chief Investment Officer at Satori Neuro, and a trained neuroscientist\nMatias Serebrinsky, Co-founder and General Partner at PsyMed Ventures, and the host of Business Trip, which is a great podcast if you want to go even deeper on these topics. Listen at businesstrip.fm \nChristie Nicholson, Founder of Studio Lumina, and the co-host for this panel\n\nWe’ll explore AI-powered tools for mental health, the new area of “enerceuticals” (energy replacing the “pharma”), psychedelics, and why what’s in your gut is so important to your mental state. Hear from investment experts who have a wide view of this growing startup landscape and better understand which new ventures are likely to succeed.\n\n***\nCRAFTED. is brought to you in partnership with Docker, which helps developers build, share, run and verify applications anywhere – without environment confirmation or management.

You never know what you’ll learn.” Twice a year, a small but mighty team of six people plans and executes the SAFe Summit. In this episode, Adam talks to two of those six people, Karen Lewison and Eric Neal, to find out what happens behind the scenes to successfully pull off these popular events. Karen and Eric talk about the challenges and excitement of organizing and hosting the SAFe Summit, and why it’s so important to select the right venue and create a positive attendee experience.

Scalability can be considered along two dimensions: expansive training of large language models (LLMs) and intricate distribution of reinforcement learning (RL) systems. Each has its own set of challenges, from computational demands of LLMs to complex synchronization in distributed RL.\n\nThis session explores the integration of Ray, Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) and ML accelerators like tensor processing units (TPUs) as a powerful combination to develop advanced ML systems at scale. We discuss Ray and its scalable APIs, its mature integration with GKE and ML accelerators, and demonstrate how it has been used for LLMs and re-implementing the powerful RL algorithm, Muzero.\n\nSpeakers: \n\nWatch more:\nAll sessions from Google Cloud Next → https://goo.gle/next24\n\n#GoogleCloudNext\n\nOPS213",

I will share how much 'just worked' and how much I had to adapt in the Firefox Profiler to make the visualization suit my needs, and finally show examples of interesting profiles revealing unexpected power use patterns.\n\nSlides: https://fosdem.org/2024/events/attachments/fosdem-2024-2723-power-profiling-my-entire-house-with-the-firefox-profiler/slides/22495/FOSDEM_2024_-_Power_profiling_my_entire_house_w_aMurJ6u.pdf",

              "description": "by Florian Quèze\n\nAfter showing last year how built-in power profiling features in Firefox can show very precisely how much power is used by code running in the browser, I will now show how I repurposed this tool to understand how power is used in my house.\n\nI will explain how I installed various power meters in my house, how the data is collected, stored locally, then visualized. I will share how much 'just worked' and how much I had to adapt in the Firefox Profiler to make the visualization suit my needs, and finally show examples of interesting profiles revealing unexpected power use patterns.\n\nSlides: https://fosdem.org/2024/events/attachments/fosdem-2024-2723-power-profiling-my-entire-house-with-the-firefox-profiler/slides/22495/FOSDEM_2024_-_Power_profiling_my_entire_house_w_aMurJ6u.pdf"

            "description": "Generative AI in 2024 has a consent problem. Scraped and otherwise stolen datasets are used to produce output that can directly compete with the people who generated the source data. This doesn’t have to be our future. The Common Voice project collects volunteer donated speech data to freely offer academics, industry and language activists a future where meaningful linguistic diversity is built into the digital products and services that increasingly fill our world. By teaching computers the way that real people speak, Common Voice doesn’t just offer a better connected future for global users, but presents us with one possible consent led model for community driven data collection. Together, let’s explore how community led dataset collection, design and governance structures have developed across speech datasets and look at how freely donated data, data trusts and other consent led collection models could offer a less dystopian AI future. An exploratory look at the proliferation of consent led data collection models in speech datasets, looking not only at Common Voice's CC0 donation-led approach but also looking into how data collection and governance models that offer more granular data control (like language community led data trusts) could offer AI and all of us touched by AI a less dystopian path into the future.",

            "title": "\"Birdsong as code\" by Chris Ford (Strange Loop 2023)",
            "description": "Most people intuitively understand birdsong as a form of music, yet the practical and artistic pressures on bird musicians are very different to those on human artists. In this talk, we will transcribe birdsong into code and use it to investigate how birds' musical structures differ from our own. In doing so, we will take advantage our ability to create novel and context-specific abstractions in code, which is not possible in traditional music notation.\n\nChris Ford\nDirector de Tecnología, Thoughtworks España\n@ctford\n\nChris has coded both correct and incorrect programs for many years, although he prefers the former. He has also coded both correct and incorrect musical compositions for many years, though he doesn’t really mind which. As well as a longstanding interest in functional programming, types and continuous delivery, Chris is always interested in learning better ways to write programs that do what they are supposed to do.

This talk will cover how the new PSIRT Engineering team was able to prevent future incidents from happening and reduce pressure on the incident response team by analyzing data driven metrics, digging into specific product area pain points and performing variant analysis of historic incidents.\n\nCaitlin Buckshaw\nGitHub, Product Security Engineer\n@caitlin_v3\n\nCaitlin Buckshaw is a Product Security Engineer at GitHub. With over a decade of experience in the IT/Security domain, she has channeled her skills into product security and incident response in recent years. Her mission is to employ a data-driven approach, along with an emphasis on education and her ardor for security, to delve deeper into the nuances of incidents and develop comprehensive measures to mitigate their impact and prevent future happenings.

              "description": "Working on an incident response team means you deal with fire after fire. At GitHub, we developed a team whose primary focus was not to respond to fires but to anticipate them. This talk will cover how the new PSIRT Engineering team was able to prevent future incidents from happening and reduce pressure on the incident response team by analyzing data driven metrics, digging into specific product area pain points and performing variant analysis of historic incidents.\n\nCaitlin Buckshaw\nGitHub, Product Security Engineer\n@caitlin_v3\n\nCaitlin Buckshaw is a Product Security Engineer at GitHub. With over a decade of experience in the IT/Security domain, she has channeled her skills into product security and incident response in recent years. Her mission is to employ a data-driven approach, along with an emphasis on education and her ardor for security, to delve deeper into the nuances of incidents and develop comprehensive measures to mitigate their impact and prevent future happenings. In her non-security time, she enjoys walks along the Carolina beach and gardening.\n\n----\nRecorded Sept 22, 2023 at Strange Loop 2023 in St. Louis, MO.\nhttps://thestrangeloop.com"

            "description": "Seymour Papert's book \"Mindstorms\" is a foundational document in the Constructionist theory of education. Learners learn best from the world by building things in it and physically testing its bounds, and teachers in this tradition don't teach \"at\" learners, but create rich \"microworlds\" full of insight for them to explore.\n\nThis talk will discuss my work using the Emmy computer algebra system and its powerful physics and differential geometry engine to animate microworlds instantiated beyond the laptop's glass. We'll explore a tabletop interface built for kids to explore gravity, and robots tricked by Lisp into acting like orbiting bodies. These tools represent an attempt to smuggle Papert's view of education and learning into modern classrooms, libraries and living rooms.\n\nSam Ritchie\nResearcher, Mentat Collective\n\nSam is a researcher at the Mentat Collective, currently working on a series of interactive, multiplayer computational textbooks for exploring mathematical physics and other forms of modeled reality. He has worked as an engineer at (Google) X, Stripe, Twitter, and founded Paddleguru and Racehub. Sam is most well known in the software world as the author of Summingbird, Algebird, and SICMUtils, and as the maintainer of Cascalog.

            "description": "The threading model of JVM applications has become a common source of instability and inefficiency in containerized environments. In a company like Nubank, one of the largest fintech, with a microservices architecture comprising over 1500 services, manually tuning the ideal number of threads becomes both daunting and risky.\n\nThis presentation introduces a novel approach that addresses these issues by implementing a dynamic control loop and fine-grained load-shedding mechanism. The solution continuously adjusts the number of threads during application execution, utilizing real-time signals such as CPU throttling, CPU usage, memory usage, and runtime pressure. Meanwhile, based on a configurable maximum queuing delay, our load-shedding mechanism ensures that the application remains functional under stress by only rejecting work exceeding its capacity.\n\nThis comprehensive solution has significantly improved the stability and performance of our applications while reducing associated costs.\n\nLuiz Hespanha\nSenior Staff Software Engineer @ Nubank\n@luiz_hespanha\n\nLuiz Hespanha is a Systems Performance engineer at Nubank, the most influential Latin America fintech.

However, the asynchronous nature of event-driven architectures challenges us to rethink our approaches towards our operations.\n\nNavigating the testing of asynchronous architectures poses significant challenges, prompting questions about the “what,” “where,” “when,” and “how” of implementing effective testing strategies. Observability, release, and rollback strategies become ever more critical as they need to balance with the testing strategies.\n\nIn this talk, Sheen and Sarah come together to answer some of these difficult questions and drive a conversation around building reliable and resilient event-driven architectures.

However, the asynchronous nature of event-driven architectures challenges us to rethink our approaches towards our operations.\n\nNavigating the testing of asynchronous architectures poses significant challenges, prompting questions about the “what,” “where,” “when,” and “how” of implementing effective testing strategies. Observability, release, and rollback strategies become ever more critical as they need to balance with the testing strategies.\n\nIn this talk, Sheen and Sarah come together to answer some of these difficult questions and drive a conversation around building reliable and resilient event-driven architectures.

This struggle often leads to decreased innovation and agility, hindering business growth and competitiveness.\n\nEvent-driven architecture (EDA) offers a powerful solution that extends beyond the traditional roles of producers, consumers, and brokers. It facilitates the creation of dynamic architectures that evolve, empower teams, and enhance agility, enabling businesses to thrive in rapidly changing environments.\n\nThis talk delves into how complexity can obscure the potential of event-driven architecture (EDA). We'll investigate how EDA contributes to the growth of evolutionary architectures and discuss the guardrails and governance strategies needed to manage complexity and fully harness EDA's potential.\n\nWhether you're improving your current architecture or embarking on a new journey, this session will offer actionable insights into controlling complexity and help you realize the potential of event-driven architectures.

            "description": "In the rapidly evolving landscape of cyber security, the ability to swiftly generate comprehensive and accurate security reports is paramount. This session showcases an advanced approach that leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and fine-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs), such as Cohere and Llama2, to automate the creation of detailed security reports. By incorporating account telemetry and network traffic logs as RAG, this method enhances the report's contextuality and relevance, ensuring precise and insightful incident narratives and breach analyses. \n\nA focal point of the presentation is the innovative integration of logs from OCI Cloud Guard, a key component in identifying and correlating security threats within the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI). This integration enriches the reports with specific cloud-based security insights and leverages OCI's advanced threat detection capabilities to provide a more granular understanding of the security posture. \n\nThe session discusses the integration of Oracle Database 24c's vector search capabilities into the solution, significantly improving the efficiency and accuracy of data retrieval processes involved in report generation. This cutting-edge database feature enables rapid searching of large volumes of data, including unstructured data such as logs and incident reports, by using vector embeddings to find the most relevant information for inclusion in the security reports. \n\nThe session includes a detailed walkthrough of how the combined use of RAG, fine-tuned LLMs, and Oracle Database 24c's vector search can automate the assimilation of vast amounts of data, transforming them into coherent, actionable security reports. Attendees gain insights into the practical application of these technologies in real-world security scenarios, illustrating how they can significantly reduce the time and effort required to produce security reports while simultaneously increasing their accuracy and depth of analysis. \n\nThis holistic approach streamlines the reporting process and enhances the overall security response by providing timely, data-driven insights into security incidents and breaches. The presentation aims to empower security professionals with the knowledge and tools necessary to leverage these cutting-edge technologies, ultimately strengthening their organization's security posture and incident response capabilities.\n\nMore info: https://app.aiplus.training/courses/Enhancing-Security-Report-Generation-with-RAG-and-Fine-Tuned-Language-Models\n\n→ To watch more videos like this, visit https://aiplus.training ​←\nDo You Like This Video?

Discover how pre-trained transformer networks have revolutionized search capabilities, enabling dramatically better outcomes with minimal effort. Semantic search transcends mere keyword matching by utilizing a semantic vector space that encodes the true meaning of documents, thus bridging the lexical gap caused by synonyms, spelling variations, and more. This method proves invaluable not just for single-language searches but also enhances multilingual and cross-lingual search efficiency, supporting over 100 languages effortlessly.

            "title": "James Powell - Are generator-coroutines really the answer? | PyData London 2024",
            "description": "www.pydata.org\n\nAs we all know (or, at least, as I've been trying to tell everyone,) generators in Python are an extremely powerful API design technique. A generator represents the linear decomposition of a single computation into multiple parts, and such decomposition proves very useful in practice. For example, we can model an infinite computation and only execute the portions we desire. Very similarly, we can simplify APIs that specify when a computation terminates, by modeling these computations as infinite sequences of steps, and allowing the end-user to directly control which steps are peformed. We can even interleave the parts of multiple, distinct computations (though in Python ≥3.6, this is better done with the custom async and await syntax and associated protocols.)\nA generator-coroutine offers us an alternative formulation for a state machine, but one which represents state and transitions implicitly in the form of (linearised) source text—in order words, a state machine that we can read and understand like any other regular code (and where we have arbitrary control over data-flow.)\nBut, in practice, the principles which support the use of generators (e.g., as iteration helpers,) often contrast with the code we get when we model with generator-coroutines, and a number of practical issues arise. While these issues may be surmountable (with enough effort and enough contortion,) the question remains: are generator-coroutines really the answer?\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States.

              "description": "www.pydata.org\n\nAs we all know (or, at least, as I've been trying to tell everyone,) generators in Python are an extremely powerful API design technique. A generator represents the linear decomposition of a single computation into multiple parts, and such decomposition proves very useful in practice. For example, we can model an infinite computation and only execute the portions we desire. Very similarly, we can simplify APIs that specify when a computation terminates, by modeling these computations as infinite sequences of steps, and allowing the end-user to directly control which steps are peformed. We can even interleave the parts of multiple, distinct computations (though in Python ≥3.6, this is better done with the custom async and await syntax and associated protocols.)\nA generator-coroutine offers us an alternative formulation for a state machine, but one which represents state and transitions implicitly in the form of (linearised) source text—in order words, a state machine that we can read and understand like any other regular code (and where we have arbitrary control over data-flow.)\nBut, in practice, the principles which support the use of generators (e.g., as iteration helpers,) often contrast with the code we get when we model with generator-coroutines, and a number of practical issues arise. While these issues may be surmountable (with enough effort and enough contortion,) the question remains: are generator-coroutines really the answer?\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States.

            "description": "Many real world business problems are multi-modal in nature and would benefit from using a combination of text, imagery, audio, and numerical data. Recently, there has been a surge in powerful deep learning models that fuse multiple modalities of data, however, fine-tuning, deploying, and versioning these models remains challenging for most companies. This tutorial will discuss some of the latest research in the field and then walk through several real world examples of fine-tuning, deploying, and serving multi-modal deep learning models using open source frameworks like HuggingFace, Kubeflow, and Django.\n\nMany real world business problems involve using multiple modalities of data. For instance, a chatbot aimed at helping someone perform maintenance on a vehicle would likely perform best if it could handle both images of the vehicle and textual questions from the user. Similarly, a model predicting length of stay in the hospital that could leverage numerical data of vitals, imagery (X-Rays, MRIs, scans), and the notes from the doctor would likely perform better than a model with just numerical data.\n\nRecently, in deep learning we have seen the emergence of models that leverage multiple modalities of data such as stable diffusion, DocVQA, VideoLLAMA, and variations of GPT for visual question and answering. We have also seen advances in the multi-modal time series forecasting domain with models like EarthFormer and Crossvivit which utilize imagery to improve forecasts. However, there are still significant challenges to successfully leveraging these (and other) multi-modal architectures when solving real world business problems. It is often difficult to fine-tune these models, manage multi-modal datasets, achieve the throughput to power real world applications, and debug poor performance in production. This tutorial aims to bridge theory and practice: we will first discuss the complexities of designing multi-modal ML systems and then dive into several real-world examples such as building a deep learning system to analyze historical documents (OCR + NLP) and then a Python powered forecast of extreme weather events using both satellite imagery and numerical time series data.\n\nParticipants will leave with a solid understanding of the challenges and opportunities that multi-modal deep learning presents, the current research landscape, and open-source frameworks (such as HuggingFace, Flow Forecast, and PyTorch Geometric Temporal). Participants should have worked with Python before and have an understanding of classes, object oriented programming, and pip. Some knowledge of Docker/Kubernetes is helpful but not required.

This hands-on tutorial equips you with powerful text analysis techniques to unlock hidden insights and inform data-driven decisions. Whether you're an experienced data scientist or analyst or just starting out, this session will guide you through two text classification approaches:\n\n1) Classic Topic Modelling: Uncover recurring themes and trends within customer comments using generative probabilistic modelling approach like LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation).\n\n2) SetFit Few-Shot Learning: Fine-tune a HuggingFace (HF) sentence transformers model with minimal data to automatically categorise and label reviews, offering deeper insights into key strengths as well as opportunities for improvement.\n\nUpon completing the tutorial, you will be equipped with hands-on experience gained through the utilisation of a Google Colab notebook provided beforehand which enable you to effectively apply the tutorial's knowledge and achieve the following outcomes:\n- Apply topic modelling with necessary text pre-processing and feature engineering techniques to discover underlying topics in a collection of text.\n- Fine-tune a HF transformer on a small labeled dataset using set-fit few-shot learning method\n- Evaluate the performance of the fine-tuned transformers model\n- Use the fine-tuned model to generate classification themes on unlabelled data\n- Develop a baseline evaluation mechanism to monitor the model in production\n\nPlease follow these steps to prepare for the tutorial:\n\n1) Set up Google Colab.\n\n2) Download the data and notebooks folders from this repository: https://rb.gy/ovru2m.\n\nThis will allow you to run the notebooks and follow along with the tutorial using Google Colab!\n\nReady to transform your understanding of multi text classification on customers data?

Grain is a strongly-typed language that aims to bring modern language features to the masses exclusively through WebAssembly. It has its roots in functional programming, but is flexible enough to suit your programming style while helping you catch bugs before runtime. This talk will give you a formal introduction to the language and a new outlook on the future WebAssembly ecosystem.",

              "description": "https://2021.webassembly-summit.org\n\nWhile WebAssembly allows us to compile many of the languages that we know and love to something browser-compatible, it also opens the door for brand-new languages to share the stage with JavaScript. Grain is a strongly-typed language that aims to bring modern language features to the masses exclusively through WebAssembly. It has its roots in functional programming, but is flexible enough to suit your programming style while helping you catch bugs before runtime. This talk will give you a formal introduction to the language and a new outlook on the future WebAssembly ecosystem."

With the addition of the interpreter, JavaScriptCore now uses three tiers to execute WebAssembly: LLInt, BBQ and OMG. Because of the new interpreter, WebAssembly programs executing in JavaScriptCore now start up 3x faster. Because of the three-tiered approach, we were able to achieve this while maintaining the same throughput performance.\n\nhttps://2020.webassembly-summit.org"

It ingests software security metadata and stores it in a persistent graph database to query for consolidated information about your software. In this Tech Talk, you will meet the GUAC maintainers as they cover the project and its recent release, roadmap plans, and how you can contribute. Cybersecurity threats are constantly and quickly changing, but GUAC can help you stay ahead.\n\nLearn more about the Tech Talk: https://openssf.org/resources/tech-talks/openssf-tech-talk-proactive-supply-chain-security-with-guac/"

            "description": "In this Lambda World 2019 presentation, Laura Castro looks at the process of testing the robustness of an Erlang-based system.\n\nPresentation Description:\n\nIn the world of distributed, highly concurrent and scalable systems, few technologies can live up to Erlang/OTP's potential. But, as we often hear, with great power comes great responsibility . . . What if we have designed the architecture of our background to be scalable and used Erlang/OTP to implement it? What now? Should we go straight ahead and jump into the production pool?\n\nSit and wait for thousands, millions of requests to come? In this talk, we'll see how we can test the robustness of our system in a controlled setting, and in an automated, effective way. Using ProER, a property-based testing tool that follows into the footsteps of the famous QuickCheck, we will see how our software's validation can be both a challenge and a cool task, when we put the right tools in practice.\n\n------\nFollow: \n-https://www.twitter.com/lambda_world \n-https://www.twitter.com/47deg\n-https://twitter.com/lauramcastro\n\nVisit: \n-https://www.47deg.com/events for more details\n-http://www.lambda.world",

              "description": "In this Lambda World 2019 presentation, Laura Castro looks at the process of testing the robustness of an Erlang-based system.\n\nPresentation Description:\n\nIn the world of distributed, highly concurrent and scalable systems, few technologies can live up to Erlang/OTP's potential. But, as we often hear, with great power comes great responsibility . . . What if we have designed the architecture of our background to be scalable and used Erlang/OTP to implement it? What now? Should we go straight ahead and jump into the production pool?\n\nSit and wait for thousands, millions of requests to come? In this talk, we'll see how we can test the robustness of our system in a controlled setting, and in an automated, effective way. Using ProER, a property-based testing tool that follows into the footsteps of the famous QuickCheck, we will see how our software's validation can be both a challenge and a cool task, when we put the right tools in practice.\n\n------\nFollow: \n-https://www.twitter.com/lambda_world \n-https://www.twitter.com/47deg\n-https://twitter.com/lauramcastro\n\nVisit: \n-https://www.47deg.com/events for more details\n-http://www.lambda.world"

This presentation was delivered at Lambda World in Cádiz, Spain on October 18, 2019.\n\nPresentation Description:\n\nWhat if compile time and type level programming in functional programming languages were easy, something you reach for without even thinking about it? What if you could debug type errors with a simple compile time print statement? Write highly flexible systems by being able to introspect into types at compile time? Pre-calculate large portions of your programs for great efficiency?\n\nTyped functional programming is a great and fun way to write resilient software, and as type systems have become more and more expressive in recent years, we are able to program sophisticated and useful properties at the type level for even better compile time safety. Just one problem: It is very difficult, requires advanced knowledge of the type system, the syntax is convoluted, the error messages are impenetrable, and it is nearly impossible to debug.\n\nThis talk will dive into why we should steal static introspection from languages like Nim, and D, state-of-the-art imperative programming languages which can solve all these issues, make type systems much more approachable without losing any expressive power, and offer new design possibilities for functional programs.\n\n------\nFollow: \n-https://www.twitter.com/lambda_world \n-https://www.twitter.com/47deg\n-https://twitter.com/deech\n\nVisit: \n-https://www.47deg.com/events for more details\n-http://www.lambda.world",
