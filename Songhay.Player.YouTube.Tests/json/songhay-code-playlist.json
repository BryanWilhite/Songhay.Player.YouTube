We will use two examples from the standard library to demonstrate this and show how in one place, the standard's interpretation of amortized constant complexity is at odds with the usual use of the term.\n---\n\nSponsored by JetBrains: https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/\n---\n\nAndreas Weis\n \nAndreas Weis has been writing C++ code in many different domains, from real-time graphics, to distributed applications, to embedded systems. As a library writer by nature, he enjoys writing portable code and exposing complex functionalities through simple, richly-typed interfaces. Both of which C++ allows him to do extensively.\nAndreas is also one of the co-organizers of the Munich C++ User Group, which allows him to share this passion with others on a regular basis.\n---\n\nCppCon is the annual, week-long face-to-face gathering for the entire C++ community. The conference is organized by the C++ community for the community. You will enjoy inspirational talks and a friendly atmosphere designed to help attendees learn from each other, meet interesting people, and generally have a stimulating experience. Taking place this year in Aurora, Colorado, near the Denver airport, and including multiple diverse tracks, the conference will appeal to anyone from C++ novices to experts.\nAnnual CppCon Conference - https://www.cppcon.org\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/cppcon\nhttps://x.com/cppcon\nhttps://www.facebook.com/CppConference\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/cppcon/\nhttps://mastodon.social/@CppCon\n---\n\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com\nYouTube Channel Managed by Digital Medium Ltd: https://events.digital-medium.co.uk\n---\n\n#cpp #cplusplus #cppcon #cppprogramming #cplusplusprogramming #softwaredevelopment #softwareengineering #coding #code #computerscience #technology #technews #programming #programmer"

In similar fashion to the popular \"State of Go\" talk I will begin by discussing all of the exciting new features and changes that have happened over the past year, since last FOSDEM. Following that I will go into a live demo showcasing how Delve can leverage Mozilla RR in order to perform deterministic debugging. This talk will begin by introducing users to the concept of deterministic debugging and the power that comes with it. Following that I will launch into a demo showcasing how to leverage this concept to debug an otherwise unpredictable highly concurrent program. Users will walk away with immediate practical knowledge they can begin applying in their day to day debugging.\nIt's been a year since last FOSDEM and a lot has changed with Delve! I will discuss all the new features and changes that have been implemented in the last year.\n\n\nFollowing the \"State of Delve\" introduction, I will dig into how Delve can be utilized to perform deterministic debugging. This style of debugging enables users to record the execution of their process and \"play it back\" in a deterministic fashion in order to more quickly and efficiently perform root cause analysis on a bug that may otherwise be difficult to reproduce or track down. This section of the talk will begin by introducing the concept of deterministic debugging and why it is so useful and powerful. Once everyone is familiar with the concept I will launch into a live demo showcasing how to leverage this debugging approach to track down and fix a bug which is hard to reproduce and happens only intermittently.\n\n\nAttendees will walk away with practical knowledge that they can begin applying to their debugging problems immediately.\n\nRoom: UB2.252A (Lameere)\nScheduled start: 2020-02-02 11:00:00",

            "description": "Maggy: Asynchronous distributed hyperparameter optimization based on Apache Spark Asynchronous algorithms on a bulk-synchronous system\nby Moritz Meister\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2020\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2020/UB5.132/maggy.webm\n\nMaggy is an open-source framework built on Apache Spark, for asynchronous parallel execution of trials for machine learning experiments. In this talk, we will present our work to tackle search as a general purpose method efficiently with Maggy, focusing on hyperparameter optimization. We show that an asynchronous system enables state-of-the-art optimization algorithms and allows extensive early stopping in order to increase the number of trials that can be performed in a given period of time on a fixed amount of resources.\nIn \"The Bitter Lesson of AI\", Rich Sutton (father of reinforcement learning) claimed that general purpose methods (like search and learning) that scale with increased computation are the future of AI. Apache Spark is a general purpose framework for scaling out data processing with available compute, but there are challenges in making Sparks' bulk-synchronous execution mechanism work efficiently with search and (deep) learning.\nIn this talk, we will present our work on Maggy, an open-source framework to tackle search as a general purpose method efficiently on Spark. Spark can be used to deploy basic optimizers (grid search, random search, differential evolution) proposing combinations of hyperparameters (trials) that are run synchronously in parallel on executors. However, many such trials perform poorly, and a lot of CPU and hardware accelerator cycles are wasted on trials that could be stopped early, freeing up resources for other trials. What is needed is support for asynchronous mechanisms.\nMaggy is an asynchronous hyperparameter optimization framework built on Spark that is able to transparently schedule and manage hyperparameter trials, by allowing limited communication, thereby increasing resource utilization, and massively increasing the number of trials that can be performed in a given period of time on a fixed amount of resources. Maggy is also built to support parallel ablation studies and applies to black box optimization/search problems in general. We will report on the gains we have seen in reduced time to find good hyperparameters and improved utilization of GPU hardware. Finally, we will perform a live demo on a Jupyter notebook, showing how to integrate Maggy in existing PySpark applications.\n\nRoom: UB5.132\nScheduled start: 2020-02-02 09:30:00",

The Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) mission landed a 2000 lb rover, the size of a compact car, to explore the planes of Mars. The rover, aptly named Curiosity, will search for organic compounds, characterize the climate and geology, and continue the search for life.\n\nOne of the most challenging aspects of the mission, from an engineering perspective, was safely landing the rover on the surface. The entry descent and landing (EDL) system used a heat shield to accommodate its hypersonic entry conditions, followed by a supersonic parachute, and eight retro rockets for the powered descent phase. For its final terminal descent, a maneuver called the sky crane was used where the rover was lowered on tethers for touchdown.\n\nThe talk will describe the motivation for Mars Exploration and how the MSL EDL engineering challenges were tackled with computational modeling and cutting edge experimental techniques.\n\nRECOMMENDED BOOKS\nNASA ‚Ä¢ NASA Systems Engineering Handbook ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/3FWjqhR\nBernice Kastner ‚Ä¢ Space Mathematics ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/3oQCDKF\nKellie Gerardi ‚Ä¢ Not Necessarily Rocket Science ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/3CW4HS9\nPiers Bizony & Roger D.

For its final terminal descent, a maneuver called the sky crane was used where the rover was lowered on tethers for touchdown.\n\nThe talk will describe the motivation for Mars Exploration and how the MSL EDL engineering challenges were tackled with computational modeling and cutting edge experimental techniques.\n\nRECOMMENDED BOOKS\nNASA ‚Ä¢ NASA Systems Engineering Handbook ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/3FWjqhR\nBernice Kastner ‚Ä¢ Space Mathematics ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/3oQCDKF\nKellie Gerardi ‚Ä¢ Not Necessarily Rocket Science ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/3CW4HS9\nPiers Bizony & Roger D.

The focus is not so much on the process and ceremonies of an agile method, but more about how the code is getting written. It‚Äôs about raising code quality, learning faster, and better handling the complexity of modern software development.\n\nSoftware today is built by teams. There may be brilliant individuals and genius coders but in my experience the best designs come from a process of iteration and feedback. The best software developers share what they know and help more junior people to advance. It‚Äôs always been part of a Scrum Master‚Äôs role to encourage better teamwork and collaboration. It‚Äôs not wrong, it‚Äôs just not enough. Developers spend much of their time writing code, reviewing code and improving code. If we‚Äôre going to make a difference to the way software gets written we need coaches who also know how to code.\n\nI‚Äôm technical and I coach teams of developers. I work to influence coding decisions, spread skills and help people build better habits. In this talk I‚Äôd like to explain what a technical coach actually does and how this kind of coaching could help you and your development team.

The focus is not so much on the process and ceremonies of an agile method, but more about how the code is getting written. It‚Äôs about raising code quality, learning faster, and better handling the complexity of modern software development.\n\nSoftware today is built by teams. There may be brilliant individuals and genius coders but in my experience the best designs come from a process of iteration and feedback. The best software developers share what they know and help more junior people to advance. It‚Äôs always been part of a Scrum Master‚Äôs role to encourage better teamwork and collaboration. It‚Äôs not wrong, it‚Äôs just not enough. Developers spend much of their time writing code, reviewing code and improving code. If we‚Äôre going to make a difference to the way software gets written we need coaches who also know how to code.\n\nI‚Äôm technical and I coach teams of developers. I work to influence coding decisions, spread skills and help people build better habits. In this talk I‚Äôd like to explain what a technical coach actually does and how this kind of coaching could help you and your development team.

But why are they attracting so much attention? In this talk I'll describe how effect systems rethink how we describe effects, the simpler programming model this brings, and some of the cool new things they allow us to do.\n\nManaging effects is one of the major concerns in functional programming. Monads are currently most popular approach, but they come with several problems. For example, they are difficult to learn (to the point where monad tutorials are an ongoing joke in the community), they don't compose, and they are slow. What if there was a better way, that used a straight forward programming style, allowed mixing together all the usual effects as well as some new ones, and had great performance?\n\nEffect systems are, of course, this better approach. In this talk I'll explain the problems of effects, and why FP is so concerned with them. I'll then describe how effect systems address the problem, by decomposing effects into operations and handlers, and the straight forward programming style this allows. I'll finish by contrasting the approach to monads, and showing some of the not-so-obvious benefits that expect systems bring.\n------\n\nFollow: \n-  Twitter https://x.com/Lambda_World\n-  LinkedIn https://www.linkedin.com/company/lambda-world/\n-  Speaker https://x.com/noelwelsh?lang=es\n\nVisit: \n-https://yayyay.events for more details\n-https://lambda.world",

To quote Simon Peyton-Jones, they might not be called functional, but a lot of their features will be inspired by the functional paradigm. When we created Erlang, we were heavily influenced by functional languages, as they provided a solution to some of the problems we set out to solve.

In this talk, I will introduce Proxy ‚Äî an open-source header-only C++20 library for non-intrusive polymorphism designed and refined by Microsoft. Proxy leverages pointer-based lifetime management to offer a GC-like capability without incurring the overhead of a garbage collector. Please find more information from our GitHub repository: https://github.com/microsoft/proxy. The library‚Äôs design is a response to long-standing challenges in traditional polymorphic code. It provides an alternative to inheritance by allowing any expression, be it member functions, free functions, operators, or conversions, to participate in a unified abstraction. Developed with portability, efficiency, and ease-of-use in mind, Proxy is engineered as a freestanding solution that works consistently across platforms‚Äîfrom embedded systems to operating systems, where it has been deployed in production since 2022. Key points of discussion will include: Non-Intrusive Abstraction: How Proxy eliminates the need for inheritance, making polymorphic interfaces simpler yet powerful; Lifetime Management: The innovative approach to managing object lifetimes, which offers performance competitive with hand-crafted solutions while avoiding common pitfalls; Flexibility and Performance: Detailed considerations on balancing API accessibility and efficient resource handling in a modern C++ ecosystem; Real-World Impact: Lessons learned from using Proxy in a large-scale, production environment, and a comparison with alternative polymorphic programming techniques.

            "description": "Learn more about CRUD operations in MongoDB and earn a free Skills Badge: https://mdb.link/HELskd8cJNE-badge\nSubscribe to MongoDB YouTube‚Üí https://mdb.link/subscribe\n\nIn this video, you'll learn how to create and insert documents into a collection in MongoDB using two methods: insertOne and insertMany. We'll start by inserting a single document using the insertOne method, which automatically creates the collection if it doesn't exist. You'll see how MongoDB generates a unique _id field for every document, either from a provided value or automatically. Next, we'll dive into inserting multiple documents at once with the insertMany method, which expects an array of documents. You'll also learn how MongoDB handles unique identifiers for documents when using insertMany. By the end of this video, you'll have a clear understanding of how to insert single or multiple documents into your MongoDB collections efficiently.\n\n00:00 - Introduction  \n00:07 - What is insertOne?  \n00:38 - Auto-Creating Collections  \n01:15 - Understanding the _id Field  \n01:29 - Using insertMany\n02:18 - Recap and Key Takeaways  \n\nVisit Mongodb.com ‚Üí https://www.mongodb.com\nRead the MongoDB Blog ‚Üí https://www.mongodb.com/blog",

              "description": "Learn more about CRUD operations in MongoDB and earn a free Skills Badge: https://mdb.link/HELskd8cJNE-badge\nSubscribe to MongoDB YouTube‚Üí https://mdb.link/subscribe\n\nIn this video, you'll learn how to create and insert documents into a collection in MongoDB using two methods: insertOne and insertMany. We'll start by inserting a single document using the insertOne method, which automatically creates the collection if it doesn't exist. You'll see how MongoDB generates a unique _id field for every document, either from a provided value or automatically. Next, we'll dive into inserting multiple documents at once with the insertMany method, which expects an array of documents. You'll also learn how MongoDB handles unique identifiers for documents when using insertMany. By the end of this video, you'll have a clear understanding of how to insert single or multiple documents into your MongoDB collections efficiently.\n\n00:00 - Introduction  \n00:07 - What is insertOne?  \n00:38 - Auto-Creating Collections  \n01:15 - Understanding the _id Field  \n01:29 - Using insertMany\n02:18 - Recap and Key Takeaways  \n\nVisit Mongodb.com ‚Üí https://www.mongodb.com\nRead the MongoDB Blog ‚Üí https://www.mongodb.com/blog"

We cannot afford another Internet Explorer situation, where one or a handful of powerful corporations seize control of fundamental technology. Open source AI can and must offer a viable, competitive alternative to closed source commercial offerings.\n\nTo help this happen, Mozilla's Builders program sponsors and co-develops projects that advance the state of the art in open source AI. This session will showcase these projects (including Llamafile, sqlite-vec, Web Applets, LocalScore, and others), outline Mozilla's vision for open source AI, and describe how we seek to collaborate with independent developers and the open source community at large.",

We cannot afford another Internet Explorer situation, where one or a handful of powerful corporations seize control of fundamental technology. Open source AI can and must offer a viable, competitive alternative to closed source commercial offerings.\n\nTo help this happen, Mozilla's Builders program sponsors and co-develops projects that advance the state of the art in open source AI. This session will showcase these projects (including Llamafile, sqlite-vec, Web Applets, LocalScore, and others), outline Mozilla's vision for open source AI, and describe how we seek to collaborate with independent developers and the open source community at large."

And when we suddenly involve cloud computing, there are even more excuses not to test your applications and infrastructure.\n\nIn this talk, I will explain and demonstrate some of the many options you have in Azure for testing every part of your development life cycle. I go through everything from A/B testing to performance testing to architecture testing, all sprinkled with animal photos.\n\nJoin me. Enough of your excuses."

And that .NET adds a try/catch block to each of these classes, potentially hiding thrown exceptions? It's true!\n\nIn this session, we will learn how to best use async/await in C# by analyzing how .NET compiles our async code.\n\nJoin me as we take an existing app and optimize its async code together, showing off performance gains, better exception handling, improved run-time speed, and smaller app size!",

And that .NET adds a try/catch block to each of these classes, potentially hiding thrown exceptions? It's true!\n\nIn this session, we will learn how to best use async/await in C# by analyzing how .NET compiles our async code.\n\nJoin me as we take an existing app and optimize its async code together, showing off performance gains, better exception handling, improved run-time speed, and smaller app size!"

            "description": "Second Brain, Powered by Kernel Memory\n\nEver wished you could instantly retrieve that one link, note, or thought you saved months ago? Enter your Second Brain ‚Äî an AI-powered memory layer built using [Microsoft's] Kernel Memory. In this session, we‚Äôll walk you through how we're building a personal memory system that indexes everything from saved links and old notes to scattered snippets of knowledge ‚Äî and makes them searchable, contextual, and useful.\n\nThis isn‚Äôt just about search ‚Äî it‚Äôs about synthesis. With embeddings, chunking strategies, and smart retrieval, we'll see how Kernel Memory can turn personal chaos into structured recall. Think of it as your own ChatGPT, trained on your brain.\n\nWhether you're building productivity tools, intelligent assistants, or just want to stop losing your best ideas ‚Äî this talk will show you how to get started with your own Second Brain.\n\nSpeaker - Aneesh Gopalakrishnan\n\nAneesh is a software engineer, open-source contributor, and founder of tools like Remitto (for international money transfers) and Parkr (because NYC parking is its own boss level). He also created ng2-pdfjs-viewer, a PDF viewer for Angular with nearly 6 million downloads ‚Äî maintained long after it was supposed to be ‚Äújust a weekend project.‚Äù \n\nHe runs Startup+, one of NYC‚Äôs fastest-growing communities for founders, makers, and early-stage dreamers. What started with a few people over drinks has turned into 75+ in-person events and 25,000 members ‚Äî from pitch nights to packed meetups with real conversation (and actual snacks). \n\nLately, he‚Äôs been diving deep into Semantic Kernel and AI agent frameworks, building smarter chatbots and experimenting with personal memory systems. If you're curious about where AI meets real-world utility ‚Äî or just want to swap notes on why your build suddenly broke ‚Äî he‚Äôs probably got a story or two.\n\nCredits\nPhoto curated by Balaji Kandasamy\nPhoto by Milad Fakurian on Unsplash",

What started with a few people over drinks has turned into 75+ in-person events and 25,000 members ‚Äî from pitch nights to packed meetups with real conversation (and actual snacks). \n\nLately, he‚Äôs been diving deep into Semantic Kernel and AI agent frameworks, building smarter chatbots and experimenting with personal memory systems. If you're curious about where AI meets real-world utility ‚Äî or just want to swap notes on why your build suddenly broke ‚Äî he‚Äôs probably got a story or two.\n\nCredits\nPhoto curated by Balaji Kandasamy\nPhoto by Milad Fakurian on Unsplash"

            "description": "Revolutionizing Workflow with Microsoft Copilot¬†Tools\n\nWould you like a tool that takes care of much of your grunt work, so you can focus on the things that add real value?\n\nIn this presentation, we will explore the many capabilities of Microsoft Copilot tools, which leverage innovative AI technology to enhance productivity and efficiency across various domains. We will begin with an introduction to the importance of AI and automation in modern software development, followed by an overview of Copilot‚Äôs products and their key features.\n\nThe presentation will cover several Copilot tools, including GitHub Copilot, Microsoft 365 Copilot, Copilot for Security, Copilot for Dynamics 365 and Power Platform. Each section will delve into how these tools assist software developers, business professionals, and security teams in streamlining their workflows, automating repetitive tasks, and improving overall¬†performance.\n\nSpeaker - David Giard\n\nDavid Giard is a former accountant and a former biochemist, who has been developing solutions using Microsoft technologies for over three decades.

            "description": "Replace your Github Action YAML with C# using NUKE\n\nWhether it's through, Github, Jenkins, TeamCity, or another, managing your own deployment pipeline is a common responsibility for development teams nowadays.\n\nBut your deployment pipeline shouldn't be a bottleneck! Teams typically rely on JSON or YAML to build pipelines. While there's nothing wrong with these, they can become tedious, error-prone, and difficult to scale once they grow into hundreds or thousands of lines.\n\nWhat if you could write your pipeline in C# instead?\n\nNUKE is a relatively new build management tool for .NET projects. Using NUKE, you can write your Github Actions, build scripts, and more in plain old C#, rather than JSON or YAML. By leveraging C#, teams gain all the tooling they're already familiar with, such as IDEs, type safety, and code completion.\n\nThis talk will go over what NUKE is, what you can gain from using it over typical alternatives, and show a live demo with NUKE in action.\n\nSpeaker - Daniel Ward\n\nDaniel is a Microsoft .NET MVP and software consultant at Lean TECHniques.

Leveraging context (e.g., Retrieval Augmented Generation, or RAG), reasoning, and access to external tools or functions (Agents), are front and center.

While offering flexibility and accessibility, the open nature of these models can expose them to specific vulnerabilities and attack vectors. This talk will explore the emerging security landscape surrounding open-source LLMs, discussing risks such as data poisoning, model inference attacks, and supply chain compromises. Understanding these threats is vital for developers and users to leverage LLMs safely and effectively. We will delve into key security considerations and potential mitigation strategies for building and deploying secure open-source LLM applications.",

This is, in part, due to the fact that the term ‚ÄúSoftware Supply Chain Attack‚Äù actually refers to a set of attacks that include: Repo Jacking, Repo Poisoning, Typo Squatting, and Dependency Confusion. Threat actors, such as Nation states, select high value targets that can be extremely disruptive. They weaponize the software supply chain against their enemies (real or perceived) to wreak physical infrastructure damage or engage in commercial and governmental espionage. Attackers who are motivated by money have been able to demand huge ransoms, which would have been impractical in the past but have been made easy by cryptocurrencies. Frequently, they seek soft targets. Hospitals, municipalities and schools can be notoriously lax in their software security efforts. Often, they lack the capital and expertise to enable a successful defense against ransomware gangs. \n\n\nGovernments and the private sector are investing in defensive measures. Europe has responded with the Cyber Resilience Act. The US has mandated SBOMs as a countermeasure against supply chain attacks. If you know what is in your code then such an attack is unlikely. Right? Not exactly. In the commercial sector, a huge software security industry has arisen. In 2023 it was estimated to be valued at approximately 172 billion USD and it is a growing market.

Graviola heavily reuses formally verified assembly from the AWS s2n-bignum project -- giving excellent performance and assurance. I'll talk about what that means, why it is important for cryptography, and how Graviola compares to other Rust cryptography crates. I'll cover some of the more unique technical aspects, such as the workflow for consuming stand-alone assembly in Rust in a portable and readable way, and why it is completely OK to have 1500 macros in a crate.",

              "description": "In this talk I will introduce you to 'Graviola', which is a new cryptography crate for Rust. Graviola heavily reuses formally verified assembly from the AWS s2n-bignum project -- giving excellent performance and assurance. I'll talk about what that means, why it is important for cryptography, and how Graviola compares to other Rust cryptography crates. I'll cover some of the more unique technical aspects, such as the workflow for consuming stand-alone assembly in Rust in a portable and readable way, and why it is completely OK to have 1500 macros in a crate."

Understanding the dependencies that we build on top of is crucial when building software that is both secure and trustworthy.In this talk, I'll discuss the tools and techniques that are available to Rustaceans to understand their dependencies, evaluate them both from security and sustainability perspectives, and make informed decisions when building with Rust. I'll also touch on work that is taking place ‚Äî across many organisations, including the Rust project itself, the Rust Foundation, OpenSSF, and the broader FOSS ecosystem ‚Äî that is helping here, both for Rust specifically and more broadly for all users of FOSS.",

              "description": "2024 shone an even brighter spotlight on the issue of supply chain security. Understanding the dependencies that we build on top of is crucial when building software that is both secure and trustworthy.In this talk, I'll discuss the tools and techniques that are available to Rustaceans to understand their dependencies, evaluate them both from security and sustainability perspectives, and make informed decisions when building with Rust. I'll also touch on work that is taking place ‚Äî across many organisations, including the Rust project itself, the Rust Foundation, OpenSSF, and the broader FOSS ecosystem ‚Äî that is helping here, both for Rust specifically and more broadly for all users of FOSS."

            "description": "This talk will present how Rust‚Äôs lack of a standard Application Binary Interface (ABI) can be solved. The lack of a standard ABI in Rust means that the whole source code has to be available to the compiler. While this is less of a problem for applications, it makes writing shared libraries in Rust impossible, unless they expose items through the Foreign Function Interface (FFI) or, in other words, the C ABI. This renders Rust's type and memory model useless. This talk will explore the ways in which WebAssembly Components can be used to build extension libraries in Rust avoiding the FFI and exposing rich data types and provide a safe memory mode. It will provide insights into several ways in which widely used Rust projects, such as Zed and Zellij have implemented extensions.",

            "title": "\"Birdsong as code\" by Chris Ford (Strange Loop 2023)",
            "description": "Most people intuitively understand birdsong as a form of music, yet the practical and artistic pressures on bird musicians are very different to those on human artists. In this talk, we will transcribe birdsong into code and use it to investigate how birds' musical structures differ from our own. In doing so, we will take advantage our ability to create novel and context-specific abstractions in code, which is not possible in traditional music notation.\n\nChris Ford\nDirector de Tecnolog√≠a, Thoughtworks Espa√±a\n@ctford\n\nChris has coded both correct and incorrect programs for many years, although he prefers the former. He has also coded both correct and incorrect musical compositions for many years, though he doesn‚Äôt really mind which. As well as a longstanding interest in functional programming, types and continuous delivery, Chris is always interested in learning better ways to write programs that do what they are supposed to do. He is Director de Tecnolog√≠a for Thoughtworks Espa√±a based in Barcelona.\n\n----\nRecorded Sept 22, 2023 at Strange Loop 2023 in St. Louis, MO.\nhttps://thestrangeloop.com",

              "title": "\"Birdsong as code\" by Chris Ford (Strange Loop 2023)",
              "description": "Most people intuitively understand birdsong as a form of music, yet the practical and artistic pressures on bird musicians are very different to those on human artists. In this talk, we will transcribe birdsong into code and use it to investigate how birds' musical structures differ from our own. In doing so, we will take advantage our ability to create novel and context-specific abstractions in code, which is not possible in traditional music notation.\n\nChris Ford\nDirector de Tecnolog√≠a, Thoughtworks Espa√±a\n@ctford\n\nChris has coded both correct and incorrect programs for many years, although he prefers the former. He has also coded both correct and incorrect musical compositions for many years, though he doesn‚Äôt really mind which. As well as a longstanding interest in functional programming, types and continuous delivery, Chris is always interested in learning better ways to write programs that do what they are supposed to do. He is Director de Tecnolog√≠a for Thoughtworks Espa√±a based in Barcelona.\n\n----\nRecorded Sept 22, 2023 at Strange Loop 2023 in St. Louis, MO.\nhttps://thestrangeloop.com"

              "description": "By studying the Kolmogorov complexity of procedural generators, we end up with a fundamental theorem for programs that can generate things. There's a deep link between the knowledge we encode in a generator and the complexity of what it can output. In the end, this result helps us understand the pragmatic decisions designers have to take when developing games like Minecraft, Borderlands or Tea Garden. The talk is illustrated with interactive examples that the audience can play with.\n\nYoun√®s Rabii\nGame Designer + Generative AI Researcher\n@pyrofoux\n\nYoun√®s Rabii is a PhD researcher in game AI and the award-winning designer of games such as SUPER IS HOT, Tea Garden and Neurocracy. Their work has been previously exhibited in the French embassies and international festivals. Their current research is focused on building AI techniques that can help designers create new forms of play and storytelling. Youn√®s' work has two main goals: (1) resist the systemic oppression within the AI and game industries; (2) create games that can surprise players and designers alike.\n\n----\nRecorded Sept 22, 2023 at Strange Loop 2023 in St. Louis, MO.\nhttps://thestrangeloop.com"

            "description": "The threading model of JVM applications has become a common source of instability and inefficiency in containerized environments. In a company like Nubank, one of the largest fintech, with a microservices architecture comprising over 1500 services, manually tuning the ideal number of threads becomes both daunting and risky.\n\nThis presentation introduces a novel approach that addresses these issues by implementing a dynamic control loop and fine-grained load-shedding mechanism. The solution continuously adjusts the number of threads during application execution, utilizing real-time signals such as CPU throttling, CPU usage, memory usage, and runtime pressure. Meanwhile, based on a configurable maximum queuing delay, our load-shedding mechanism ensures that the application remains functional under stress by only rejecting work exceeding its capacity.\n\nThis comprehensive solution has significantly improved the stability and performance of our applications while reducing associated costs.\n\nLuiz Hespanha\nSenior Staff Software Engineer @ Nubank\n@luiz_hespanha\n\nLuiz Hespanha is a Systems Performance engineer at Nubank, the most influential Latin America fintech. Working in the area for more than 20 years, he‚Äôs been in microservices since before they were called that and has also built useful large-scale systems using RESTful principles and messaging-centric architectures.\n\nFlavio Brasil\nPrincipal Engineer\n@fbrasisil\n\nFlavio is a seasoned engineer with a specialization in high-performance solutions for functional programming on the JVM. Throughout his career, he has navigated a wide range of technologies, spanning from intricate JIT compilers to sophisticated libraries for functional programming.

Can we create and transplant neurons we've never seen before.\n1:33:57 ‚Äã‚ÄãMy view on questions of human modification cybernetics is that; it will never succeed (be better than biological evolution) without significant energy expenditure -- it took millions of years to get where we are.\n1:40:25 ‚Äã‚ÄãI feel like I should create a digital copy of Stephen Wolfram as my summer school project to simulate the way he thinks in an LLM.\n1:41:29 I wonder which form of language we would use if we would think like a neural net...\n1:43:34 Did you calculate at what point we would not stop eating because the brain is so big and energy hungry? And how would we get rid of the excess heat?\n1:48:04 ‚Äã‚ÄãCan the brain be optimized for size and shrunk? Can the same brain functionality be created in a smaller package I mean.\n1:49:10  ‚Äã‚ÄãI wonder if there's a limit to humor in terms of intelligence. Will it disappear entirely at some level?\n1:51:30 ‚Äã‚ÄãCould bigger brains visualize higher dimensional objects?\n1:53:25 What does this mean about concepts like IQ?\n2:00:01 Are minds a result of having rulial limits?\n2:03:39 End Stream\n\nFollow us on our official social media channels.\n\nX: https://x.com/WolframResearch/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/wolframresearch/\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/wolframresearch/\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/wolfram-research/\nStephen Wolfram's Twitter: https://twitter.com/stephen_wolfram/\n\nContribute to the official Wolfram Community: https://community.wolfram.com/\nStay up-to-date on the latest interest at Wolfram Research through our blog: https://blog.wolfram.com/\nFollow Stephen Wolfram's life, interests, and what makes him tick on his blog: https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/"

Would you agree and what else would you see possible with such power in the hands of individual users and their PCs? Imagine: video feeds, sensor arrays, radio, satellite feeds, weather stations, etc.\n17:17  Do you see AI systems being integrated more directly into operating systems? And personal data is getting isolated more in devices, moving away from cloud-based integrations. I am considering using an open-source OS and seeing what it's like to integrate AI more tightly into it. For example, instead of needing several applications to query the AI models, do it on a device directly as part of the OS. I am considering this from a data security standpoint and user usability. Creating individual personalised AI.\n28:28 Is is a possibility for AIs to take my ideas I've fed it and suggest it to other users?\n30:27 Are there protections against web scraping that LLMs do?\n34:05 The problem with the generative art is that all the platform that offer models to achieve this have prompt templates that just blatantly contain all sorts of artists names - to imitate their styles.\n38:50 Do you think that advocacy for digital privacy rights can be compatible with AI advancement or prove to be a deterrent?\n44:22 I've gotten messages from ChatGPT saying it can't make an image due to copyright, but if I hit retry it will more often than not make the image, how does this happen?\n46:30 ‚Äã‚ÄãI talked to chatGPT about how it creates text and it sounded similar to your ideas on emergent properties in the universe. Is this a coincidence that those are similar or is it a fundamental rule?\n48:36 ‚Äã‚ÄãI like to speculate about wild existential theories with most models, but they do give in too easily in discussions and they are very good at exaggerating\n49:45 Will LLMs ever get to a point of not making stuff up? Or will they always need some sort of supporting software to crosscheck with?\n52:57 Any future plans for similar discussions with a robot? Could be interesting to see the evolution of those over time.\n53:18 Would you rather have AI  robots as students or teachers at your summer school?\n57:39 When will you hire your first AI worker? What do imagine they will do?\n59:54 ‚Äã‚ÄãPersonally, I find that having a human that cares and can connect with the students is more successful in teaching me than AI, however, AI can be faster because its accessible at any time of the day.\n1:03:36 Going forward, would you start teaching coding (to kids and others) starting first with an LLM interface or directly in a formal language as has been done up to now?\n1:07:43 How can teachers motivate students?\n1:12:12 I vividly remember when I saw my first Computer (Apple IIe).
