They discuss how modern Java performance must account for cloud native architectures, with applications running across distributed microservices and containerized, single-core environments.\n\nThe book focuses on the importance of measuring relevant data, warns against relying on misleading micro-benchmarks, and highlights how system-level benchmarks offer a clearer picture. Ben also delves into the JVM\u0027s hidden complexities, such as changes in Java 17 and the impact of virtual threads. Practical, real-world examples in the book, like the \u0022fighting animals\u0022 microservices application, help developers learn how to optimize Java performance in real network environments.\n\nFinally, Ben touches on the future of Java concurrency, with virtual threads and structured concurrency offering new ways to handle performance challenges in cloud native systems.\n\nRECOMMENDED BOOKS\nBen Evans \u0026 Jim Gough \u2022 Optimizing Cloud Native Java\n (https://amzn.to/41nivD9) Ben Evans, Jason Clark \u0026 David Flanagan \u2022 Java in a Nutshell\n (https://amzn.to/43FDoMA) Ben Evans, Martijn Verburg \u0026 Jason Clark \u2022 The Well-Grounded Java Developer\n (https://amzn.to/41JMG7N) Ben Evans, Jim Gough \u0026 Chris Newland \u2022 Optimizing Java\n (https://amzn.to/4bNOfGh) Ben Evans \u0026 Martijn Verburg \u2022 The Well-Grounded Java Developer (https://amzn.to/4hs9MWk) \n\n\nBluesky (https://bsky.app/profile/gotocon.com) \nTwitter (https://twitter.com/GOTOcon) \nInstagram (https://www.instagram.com/goto_con) \nLinkedIn (https://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-) \nFacebook (https://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences) \n\nCHANNEL MEMBERSHIP BONUS\nJoin this channel to get early access to videos \u0026 other perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs_tLP3AiwYKwdUHpltJPuA/join\n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO conference near you!
