Vlad shares his journey from a failed microservices project to his deep dive into the principles of coupling, drawing insights from a 1970s structured design book.\n\nThe duo discusses the timeless nature of coupling in software, how modern systems like microservices and cloud architectures still rely on age-old design principles, and the importance of understanding complexity for better problem decomposition and estimation. Vlad also reveals his unique approach to the book\u2014integrating AI-generated poetry into each chapter to help readers grasp complex concepts. With a focus on modularity as the antidote to complexity, Vlad emphasizes that by managing coupling, engineers can create more maintainable, scalable systems.\n\nRECOMMENDED BOOKS\nVlad Khononov \u2022 Balancing Coupling in Software Design\n (https://amzn.to/4iGpbDv) Vlad Khononov \u2022 Learning Domain-Driven Design\n (https://amzn.to/41EVhIX) Sheen Brisals \u0026 Luke Hedger \u2022 Serverless Development on AWS\n (https://amzn.to/3W3Sw2f) Glenford Myers \u2022 Composite/Structured Design\n (https://amzn.to/4kVblPN) Vaughn Vernon \u2022 Implementing Domain-Driven Design\n (https://amzn.to/41Mpk2E) Eric Evans \u2022 Domain-Driven Design\n (https://amzn.to/43lNxhv) van Kelle, Verschatse \u0026 Baas-Schwegler \u2022 Collaborative Software Design\n (https://amzn.to/4iv0N8I) Nick Tune \u0026 Jean-Georges Perrin \u2022 Architecture Moderniza (https://amzn.to/4b5ASiN) \n\n\nBluesky (https://bsky.app/profile/gotocon.com) \nTwitter (https://twitter.com/GOTOcon) \nInstagram (https://www.instagram.com/goto_con) \nLinkedIn (https://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-) \nFacebook (https://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences) \n\nCHANNEL MEMBERSHIP BONUS\nJoin this channel to get early access to videos \u0026 other perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs_tLP3AiwYKwdUHpltJPuA/join\n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO conference near you!

Vlad shares his journey from a failed microservices project to his deep dive into the principles of coupling, drawing insights from a 1970s structured design book.\n\nThe duo discusses the timeless nature of coupling in software, how modern systems like microservices and cloud architectures still rely on age-old design principles, and the importance of understanding complexity for better problem decomposition and estimation. Vlad also reveals his unique approach to the book\u2014integrating AI-generated poetry into each chapter to help readers grasp complex concepts. With a focus on modularity as the antidote to complexity, Vlad emphasizes that by managing coupling, engineers can create more maintainable, scalable systems.\n\nRECOMMENDED BOOKS\nVlad Khononov \u2022 Balancing Coupling in Software Design\n (https://amzn.to/4iGpbDv) Vlad Khononov \u2022 Learning Domain-Driven Design\n (https://amzn.to/41EVhIX) Sheen Brisals \u0026 Luke Hedger \u2022 Serverless Development on AWS\n (https://amzn.to/3W3Sw2f) Glenford Myers \u2022 Composite/Structured Design\n (https://amzn.to/4kVblPN) Vaughn Vernon \u2022 Implementing Domain-Driven Design\n (https://amzn.to/41Mpk2E) Eric Evans \u2022 Domain-Driven Design\n (https://amzn.to/43lNxhv) van Kelle, Verschatse \u0026 Baas-Schwegler \u2022 Collaborative Software Design\n (https://amzn.to/4iv0N8I) Nick Tune \u0026 Jean-Georges Perrin \u2022 Architecture Moderniza (https://amzn.to/4b5ASiN) \n\n\nBluesky (https://bsky.app/profile/gotocon.com) \nTwitter (https://twitter.com/GOTOcon) \nInstagram (https://www.instagram.com/goto_con) \nLinkedIn (https://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-) \nFacebook (https://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences) \n\nCHANNEL MEMBERSHIP BONUS\nJoin this channel to get early access to videos \u0026 other perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs_tLP3AiwYKwdUHpltJPuA/join\n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO conference near you!
