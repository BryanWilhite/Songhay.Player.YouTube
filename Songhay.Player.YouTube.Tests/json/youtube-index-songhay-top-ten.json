He explains how uncertainty defines the architect\u0027s role and introduces residuality\u2014a method where architects deliberately stress their conceptual models until they collapse, then optimize the resulting \u0022residues\u0022 or leftovers to create more resilient systems.\n\nUnlike traditional software engineering approaches, that try to eliminate uncertainty through rigid requirements, residuality embraces random stressors (even far-fetched scenarios like giant lizards) to uncover architectural fault lines.\n\nO\u0027Reilly argues that this playful yet mathematically sound approach produces more robust architectures than conventional methods, and his second book explores how inherited philosophical thinking often undermines software architecture\u0027s effectiveness in complex business contexts.\n\nRECOMMENDED BOOKS\nBarry O\u0027Reilly \u2022 Residues\n (https://leanpub.com/residuality) Barry O\u0027Reilly \u2022 The Architect\u0027s Paradox\n (https://leanpub.com/architectsparadox) Jacqui Read \u2022 Communication Patterns\n (https://amzn.to/3E37lvv) Anne Currie \u0026 Jamie Dobson \u2022 The Cloud Native Attitude\n (https://amzn.to/3R0exeT) Gregor Hohpe \u2022 The Software Architect Elevator\n (https://amzn.to/3F6d2ax) Gregor Hohpe \u2022 Enterprise Integration Patterns, Vol 2 (https://amzn.to/3TNedQ3) \n\n\nBluesky (https://bsky.app/profile/gotocon.com) \nTwitter (https://twitter.com/GOTOcon) \nInstagram (https://www.instagram.com/goto_con) \nLinkedIn (https://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-) \nFacebook (https://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences) \n\nCHANNEL MEMBERSHIP BONUS\nJoin this channel to get early access to videos \u0026 other perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs_tLP3AiwYKwdUHpltJPuA/join\n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO conference near you!
