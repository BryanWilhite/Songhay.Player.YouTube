While reactive cybersecurity measures will help organizations respond to past and present threats, offensive measures are the only chance to get ahead of attackers and beat them to the punch. There is now a greater call for offensive solutions like penetration testing and red teaming to evaluate environments so security gaps can be identified and closed before a breach. Join us as we discuss how these solutions work both independently and together, as well as practical ways organizations can build or mature an offensive security strategy. \r\n\r\nSegment Resources:\r\nhttps://www.coresecurity.com/resources/videos/when-use-pen-testing-red-teaming-or-both?code=cmp-0000011540&ls=717710006&utm_source=hubspot&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=cts-security-weekly\r\n\r\nhttps://www.coresecurity.com/resources/guides/complete-guide-layering-offensive-security?code=cmp-0000011540&ls=717710006&utm_source=hubspot&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=cts-security-weekly\r\n\r\nhttps://www.coresecurity.com/resources/datasheets/offensive-security-advanced-bundle?code=cmp-0000011540&ls=717710006&utm_source=hubspot&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=cts-security-weekly \r\n\r\nThis segment is sponsored by Fortra.

Yes you heard that right!!! \nBut You know what?? even then because of the extraordinary contribution and initiatives of legends like Homi Bhabha, Indira Gandhi, Lal Bahadur Shastri, Dorabji Tata, Atal Bihari Vajpayee and the legendary Abdul Kalam, today, India stands as a powerful nuclear state!!! This journey took us 51 years and 2 Generations of leaders and scientists to reach the destination!!!! and today their dedication is the reason why India stands at a respectable position in the world economy!!!

You see the core reason why Saudi Arabia is super powerful is because, it is the 3rd largest producer of oil in the world. and more importantly, it also has the second largest oil reserve in the world.\n\n\nThink School is a Digital School that we all deserved, but never had\n►►Check out Think School's Online courses: https://www.thethinkschool.co.in\n\n\n\n⬇️Our Top 2022 Playlist\nGeopolitics:\nIndia is Trapping China - https://youtu.be/I7vz7Ym82_4\nOil Giants Crushing Europe - https://youtu.be/aGVtLubW9q0 \nIsrael’s Secret Strategies - https://youtu.be/ec9Nwka9kBg\nChina vs India Military Strategy in Ladakh - https://youtu.be/tTlwfnZAdQk \nUpcoming US Recession Affects Indian Economy - https://youtu.be/HofmLFn6MTo\n\nBest of Business:\n1.

It’s the gift that keeps on giving. I mean, Brazil OKed the deal. COME ON\n• Microsoft Teams turned 5. Is it unstoppable? (Stack is asking for a friend) \n• Games in Teams?\n• Just one feature update per year? Just kidding! Microsoft released Windows 10 version 22H2 in October. Since then, we’ve seen the unexpected, largely (or completely) untested rollout of three new features: Search “pill,” Task Manager access from the Taskbar, and now a new OneDrive. Each has inconsistently rolled out to different PCs. One has a regression. One was actually tested with the Insider Program. And one wasn’t tested at all.\n• Don’t like Windows 11? Please, let the designers explain it\n• One Outlook (Project Monarch) arrives, sort of, changes nothing\n• Loop doesn’t arrive, changes nothing\n• .NET MAUI lands. Is it the future? Or just “a” future?\n• Project Voltera looks cool, but Arm is still down the road\n• DuckDuckGo colluded with Microsoft, then didn’t\n• Alex Kipman was just trying to be like Bill Gates!\n• GitHub CoPilot: friend or foe?\n• PC sales fell off a cliff. That cliff is about to get higher. Deeper. Whatever\n• Joe B leaves. Like Mad Men, he might have stuck around too long\n• The year the Insider Program broke - there is no way out of Dev, Beta, or WOA builds\n\nWindows 11\n• Microsoft brings Android 13 to WSA in preview\n\nHardware\n• Microsoft touts HoloLens 2 “momentum,” says that an HL3 will need to be “meaningful”\n• Lenovo is pre-gaming CES with major PC announcements. Isn’t this how E3 started to fall apart?\n• Google Android/Nest and Amazon both go live with early Matter implementations.\n\nMicrosoft 365\n• Microsoft will let all EU cloud customers store their data locally. \n• Microsoft teams with AWS, Meta, and TomTom to take on Google Maps\n• Microsoft, Teams has failed with consumers. Just bring back Skype already\n• In its second announcement all year, Skype adds real-time translation that imitates your voice\n• Amazon settles EU antitrust case. Did it learn anything from Microsoft?\n\nXbox\n• Microsoft launches a massive sale on Xbox games\n• Amazon expands in gaming, will publish next Tomb Raider title\n• John Carmack leaves Meta, has a lot to say.

It’s the gift that keeps on giving. I mean, Brazil OKed the deal. COME ON\n• Microsoft Teams turned 5. Is it unstoppable? (Stack is asking for a friend) \n• Games in Teams?\n• Just one feature update per year? Just kidding! Microsoft released Windows 10 version 22H2 in October. Since then, we’ve seen the unexpected, largely (or completely) untested rollout of three new features: Search “pill,” Task Manager access from the Taskbar, and now a new OneDrive. Each has inconsistently rolled out to different PCs. One has a regression. One was actually tested with the Insider Program. And one wasn’t tested at all.\n• Don’t like Windows 11? Please, let the designers explain it\n• One Outlook (Project Monarch) arrives, sort of, changes nothing\n• Loop doesn’t arrive, changes nothing\n• .NET MAUI lands. Is it the future? Or just “a” future?\n• Project Voltera looks cool, but Arm is still down the road\n• DuckDuckGo colluded with Microsoft, then didn’t\n• Alex Kipman was just trying to be like Bill Gates!\n• GitHub CoPilot: friend or foe?\n• PC sales fell off a cliff. That cliff is about to get higher. Deeper. Whatever\n• Joe B leaves. Like Mad Men, he might have stuck around too long\n• The year the Insider Program broke - there is no way out of Dev, Beta, or WOA builds\n\nWindows 11\n• Microsoft brings Android 13 to WSA in preview\n\nHardware\n• Microsoft touts HoloLens 2 “momentum,” says that an HL3 will need to be “meaningful”\n• Lenovo is pre-gaming CES with major PC announcements. Isn’t this how E3 started to fall apart?\n• Google Android/Nest and Amazon both go live with early Matter implementations.\n\nMicrosoft 365\n• Microsoft will let all EU cloud customers store their data locally. \n• Microsoft teams with AWS, Meta, and TomTom to take on Google Maps\n• Microsoft, Teams has failed with consumers. Just bring back Skype already\n• In its second announcement all year, Skype adds real-time translation that imitates your voice\n• Amazon settles EU antitrust case. Did it learn anything from Microsoft?\n\nXbox\n• Microsoft launches a massive sale on Xbox games\n• Amazon expands in gaming, will publish next Tomb Raider title\n• John Carmack leaves Meta, has a lot to say.
