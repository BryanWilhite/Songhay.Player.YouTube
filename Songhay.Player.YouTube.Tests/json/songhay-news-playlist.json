EQE SUV first drive: Bringing big luxury to a smaller SUV","description":"Mercedes has a very clear plan. Its EQ lineup will continue to grow as it works towards parity with its gas vehicles, but will eventually transform its consumer cars to those running on electrons. The latest part of that scheme is the EQE SUV. The larger, taller version of the EQE sedan. Both are eco-friendly cousins to the E-Class and both bring what we like (and don’t like) about the EQS to a broader audience. \n\nStarting at $77,900, the EQE SUV won’t wow you if you’ve been behind the wheel of literally any other Mercedes EV.

Its EQ lineup will continue to grow as it works towards parity with its gas vehicles, but will eventually transform its consumer cars to those running on electrons. The latest part of that scheme is the EQE SUV. The larger, taller version of the EQE sedan. Both are eco-friendly cousins to the E-Class and both bring what we like (and don’t like) about the EQS to a broader audience. \n\nStarting at $77,900, the EQE SUV won’t wow you if you’ve been behind the wheel of literally any other Mercedes EV. Instead, the mid-seized luxury EV is a piece of a larger puzzle. That’s not to say that the vehicle doesn’t deliver on the Mercedes-Benz promise of a luxury vehicle. It does this without the buyer having to break the $100,000 mark for an electric SUV. \n\nSubscribe: https://www.youtube.com/c/Engadget \nLike us on Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/engadget\nFollow us on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/engadget\nFollow us on Instagram: http://www.instagram.com/engadget\nFollow us on TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@engadget \n\nThe Engadget Podcast: https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-engadget-podcast/id1142790530?mt=2\nMore about Engadget Audio: https://www.engadget.com/podcasts/\n\nRead more: http://www.engadget.com"},"defaultAudioLanguage":"en"},"contentDetails":{"videoId":"64Rsis_EtzM","videoPublishedAt":"2023-04-04T22:00:13Z","duration":"PT8M26S","dimension":"2d","definition":"hd","caption":"false","licensedContent":true,"contentRating":{},"projection":"rectangular"},"status":{"uploadStatus":"processed","privacyStatus":"public","license":"youtube","embeddable":true,"publicStatsViewable":true,"madeForKids":false}},{"kind":"youtube#video","etag":"3rlN2_CUNZGTs7r8BYxPD4jshB4","id":"_DqiPnL6ECQ","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2023-04-04T11:00:20Z","channelId":"UC-6OW5aJYBFM33zXQlBKPNA","title":"The Amazon Halo Rise is my new favorite way to wake up","description":"The Halo Rise is a simple and effective bedside sleep tracker that feeds into Amazon’s overall healthcare plans by sucking you into its Halo app.\n\nPros: Simple setup, Effective sleep tracking, Inoffensive design\n\nCons: Buttons could be bigger and space further apart.\n\nEngadget Score: 80\n\nSubscribe: https://www.youtube.com/c/Engadget \nLike us on Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/engadget\nFollow us on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/engadget\nFollow us on Instagram: http://www.instagram.com/engadget\nFollow us on TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@engadget \n\nThe Engadget Podcast: https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-engadget-podcast/id1142790530?mt=2\nMore about Engadget Audio: https://www.engadget.com/podcasts/\n\nRead more: http://www.engadget.com","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_DqiPnL6ECQ/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_DqiPnL6ECQ/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_DqiPnL6ECQ/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_DqiPnL6ECQ/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_DqiPnL6ECQ/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Engadget","playlistId":"UU-6OW5aJYBFM33zXQlBKPNA","position":6,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"_DqiPnL6ECQ"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Engadget","videoOwnerChannelId":"UC-6OW5aJYBFM33zXQlBKPNA","tags":["engadget","technology","consumer tech","gadgets","science","gear","tech","amazon","review","sleep tracking","amazon halo rise","halo rise","fitbit","google nest hub","amazon health","health tracking","alarm","bedside clock","smart alarm"],"categoryId":"28","liveBroadcastContent":"none","defaultLanguage":"en","localized":{"title":"The Amazon Halo Rise is my new favorite way to wake up","description":"The Halo Rise is a simple and effective bedside sleep tracker that feeds into Amazon’s overall healthcare plans by sucking you into its Halo app.\n\nPros: Simple setup, Effective sleep tracking, Inoffensive design\n\nCons: Buttons could be bigger and space further apart.\n\nEngadget Score: 80\n\nSubscribe: https://www.youtube.com/c/Engadget \nLike us on Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/engadget\nFollow us on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/engadget\nFollow us on Instagram: http://www.instagram.com/engadget\nFollow us on TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@engadget \n\nThe Engadget Podcast: https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-engadget-podcast/id1142790530?mt=2\nMore about Engadget Audio: https://www.engadget.com/podcasts/\n\nRead more: http://www.engadget.com"},"defaultAudioLanguage":"en"},"contentDetails":{"videoId":"_DqiPnL6ECQ","videoPublishedAt":"2023-04-04T11:00:20Z","duration":"PT8M16S","dimension":"2d","definition":"hd","caption":"false","licensedContent":true,"contentRating":{},"projection":"rectangular"},"status":{"uploadStatus":"processed","privacyStatus":"public","license":"youtube","embeddable":true,"publicStatsViewable":true,"madeForKids":false}},{"kind":"youtube#video","etag":"U1kPrgqAej6d4g5o3J_kPEbtC7E","id":"RMa8FWejKFY","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2023-04-03T04:01:00Z","channelId":"UC-6OW5aJYBFM33zXQlBKPNA","title":"Hyundai Ioniq 6 first drive: A value-packed EV sedan","description":"Hyundai has built itself a reputation for delivering vehicles that offer a luxury feel at regular person prices.

This whitepaper traces the origins of digital wallets, the opportunities and obstacles in this area of development, and where the OWF comes in. \n\nRead the full report: https://www.linuxfoundation.org/research/open-wallet-foundation?hsLang=en"},"defaultAudioLanguage":"en"},"contentDetails":{"videoId":"spwHNuZGiDk","videoPublishedAt":"2023-02-27T21:20:59Z","duration":"PT1M28S","dimension":"2d","definition":"hd","caption":"false","licensedContent":false,"contentRating":{},"projection":"rectangular"},"status":{"uploadStatus":"processed","privacyStatus":"public","license":"youtube","embeddable":true,"publicStatsViewable":true,"madeForKids":false}},{"kind":"youtube#video","etag":"Myilu7l0Vp9s0PrZljPhM3_Lg08","id":"09WF3zZBcCk","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2023-02-24T16:26:40Z","channelId":"UCfX55Sx5hEFjoC3cNs6mCUQ","title":"OpenWallet Foundation Officially Launched | Interview With Founder Daniel Goldscheider","description":"Learn more here: https://openwallet.foundation/\nThe OWF is a consortium of companies and non-profit organisations collaborating to drive global adoption of open, secure and interoperable digital wallet solutions as well as providing access to expertise and advice through our Government Advisory Council.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/09WF3zZBcCk/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/09WF3zZBcCk/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/09WF3zZBcCk/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/09WF3zZBcCk/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/09WF3zZBcCk/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"The Linux Foundation","playlistId":"UUfX55Sx5hEFjoC3cNs6mCUQ","position":8,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"09WF3zZBcCk"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"The Linux Foundation","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCfX55Sx5hEFjoC3cNs6mCUQ","categoryId":"28","liveBroadcastContent":"none","localized":{"title":"OpenWallet Foundation Officially Launched | Interview With Founder Daniel Goldscheider","description":"Learn more here: https://openwallet.foundation/\nThe OWF is a consortium of companies and non-profit organisations collaborating to drive global adoption of open, secure and interoperable digital wallet solutions as well as providing access to expertise and advice through our Government Advisory Council."},"defaultAudioLanguage":"en"},"contentDetails":{"videoId":"09WF3zZBcCk","videoPublishedAt":"2023-02-24T16:26:40Z","duration":"PT13M44S","dimension":"2d","definition":"hd","caption":"false","licensedContent":false,"contentRating":{},"projection":"rectangular"},"status":{"uploadStatus":"processed","privacyStatus":"public","license":"creativeCommon","embeddable":true,"publicStatsViewable":true,"madeForKids":false}},{"kind":"youtube#video","etag":"QCixR9YOhD1VgVLduZyY0a0ohxA","id":"e1cdZ_Nzo_U","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2023-02-23T17:32:44Z","channelId":"UCfX55Sx5hEFjoC3cNs6mCUQ","title":"OpenWallet Foundation Launch: The Future of Digital Wallets","description":"Why and How Open Source Communities Will Drive Collaboration and Development of Digital Asset Custody and Interoperability\n\nAs our world becomes increasingly digitized, the same holds true for everyday assets.
