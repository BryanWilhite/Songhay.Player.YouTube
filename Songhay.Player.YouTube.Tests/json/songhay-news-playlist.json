This week, we need to talk about Controlled Feature Rollouts (CFRs). This is what happened with that Search “pill” late last year, not that Microsoft ever announced that, and it’s all about testing new features first in stable. Is the Insider Program in trouble?\n• Microsoft is adding Rust to the Windows kernel \n• Insider Program: Microsoft is testing new Widget board improvements\n• Web usage statistics show us how Edge has failed where Safari has succeeded\n• Oops! A stupid new feature in Edge is causing Microsoft to report all your web browsing to Bing\n• Intel revenues are circling the drain, but it promises a brighter future. And AMD fell hard too, with the same guidance\n\nMicrosoft 365\n• One domain to rule them all and in the darkness bind them\n• Microsoft Loop Preview now supports personal accounts\n• Microsoft Designer arrives in open preview, offers DALL-E-powered AI graphics designs\n• Links in Teams and (the new) Outlook will soon open in Edge no matter which browser you chose\n• Microsoft is overhauling OneDrive for work and school on the web. You know, eventually\n• Microsoft brings payments to SMBs in Teams with PayPal, Stripe, and... GoDaddy?\n\nSurface\n• Is Surface Duo dead? Was it ever not dead?\n• Microsoft consolidates all of its keyboards and other PC peripherals under the Surface brand\n\nXbox\n• Microsoft signs yet another 10-year Xbox deal, this time with an EU cloud streaming company\n• Microsoft “fixes” the Xbox Dashboard.

And there are two takeaways\n• Windows 11 LTSC will finally arrive in the second half of 2024\n• Windows 10 version 22H2 is the final version of Windows 10, and it will be supported with only security updates until October 14, 2025\n\nWindows 11\n• Last week, we talked about Week D monthly preview updates. This week, we need to talk about Controlled Feature Rollouts (CFRs). This is what happened with that Search “pill” late last year, not that Microsoft ever announced that, and it’s all about testing new features first in stable. Is the Insider Program in trouble?\n• Microsoft is adding Rust to the Windows kernel \n• Insider Program: Microsoft is testing new Widget board improvements\n• Web usage statistics show us how Edge has failed where Safari has succeeded\n• Oops! A stupid new feature in Edge is causing Microsoft to report all your web browsing to Bing\n• Intel revenues are circling the drain, but it promises a brighter future. And AMD fell hard too, with the same guidance\n\nMicrosoft 365\n• One domain to rule them all and in the darkness bind them\n• Microsoft Loop Preview now supports personal accounts\n• Microsoft Designer arrives in open preview, offers DALL-E-powered AI graphics designs\n• Links in Teams and (the new) Outlook will soon open in Edge no matter which browser you chose\n• Microsoft is overhauling OneDrive for work and school on the web. You know, eventually\n• Microsoft brings payments to SMBs in Teams with PayPal, Stripe, and... GoDaddy?\n\nSurface\n• Is Surface Duo dead? Was it ever not dead?\n• Microsoft consolidates all of its keyboards and other PC peripherals under the Surface brand\n\nXbox\n• Microsoft signs yet another 10-year Xbox deal, this time with an EU cloud streaming company\n• Microsoft “fixes” the Xbox Dashboard.

Let’s look at a few you may have heard before: \n\n”Viable commercial blockchain applications are too costly and time-consuming to build” (not true).\n”Data quality and credential verification are near impossible to standardize and trust” (not true).\n”Current processes/technologies are working fine and there is no need to change” (not true). \n\nMany carriers and affiliated organizations have conducted blockchain Proof of Concepts (PoCs) within their own organizational walls and found that putting a vehicle, device, or any other asset on a chain was relatively easy. However, commercial applications only scale when mutually trusted data about these assets are shared across a business network or value chain. Simply put, blockchains work best for transactions in large and complicated networks where the frictional cost of trust is high — which is unlikely to be the case within a single or small group of organizations, where simpler and cheaper means are available to establish trust, data provenance, and transaction integrity. \n\nThe result? Most blockchain PoCs, despite successfully demonstrating the technology, fail to evolve into consumer-facing and industry enterprise-level applications.

Let’s look at a few you may have heard before: \n\n”Viable commercial blockchain applications are too costly and time-consuming to build” (not true).\n”Data quality and credential verification are near impossible to standardize and trust” (not true).\n”Current processes/technologies are working fine and there is no need to change” (not true). \n\nMany carriers and affiliated organizations have conducted blockchain Proof of Concepts (PoCs) within their own organizational walls and found that putting a vehicle, device, or any other asset on a chain was relatively easy. However, commercial applications only scale when mutually trusted data about these assets are shared across a business network or value chain. Simply put, blockchains work best for transactions in large and complicated networks where the frictional cost of trust is high — which is unlikely to be the case within a single or small group of organizations, where simpler and cheaper means are available to establish trust, data provenance, and transaction integrity. \n\nThe result?
