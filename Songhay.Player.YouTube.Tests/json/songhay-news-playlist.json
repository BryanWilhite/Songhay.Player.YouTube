At the same time, it has the most advanced video features of any APS-C camera, with up to 6.2K video, 4K 120p and 1080 240p. It also offers in-body stabilization, a high-resolution EVF, CFexpress support and more. The main drawback, and it’s a small one, is that the autofocus still isn’t quite as fast as we’ve seen on Sony and Canon’s latest APS-C cameras. \n\nPros: Fast shooting, good handling, high image quality, minimal rolling shutter, excellent video capabilities\n\nCons: Expensive, stabilization not great for video, autofocus behind Canon and Sony\n\nSubscribe: https://www.youtube.com/c/Engadget \nLike us on Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/engadget\nFollow us on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/engadget\nFollow us on Instagram: http://www.instagram.com/engadget\nFollow us on TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@engadget \n\nThe Engadget Podcast: https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-engadget-podcast/id1142790530?mt=2\nMore about Engadget Audio: https://www.engadget.com/2019-08-01-engadget-podcasts.html \n\nRead more: http://www.engadget.com"},"defaultAudioLanguage":"en"},"contentDetails":{"videoId":"kv3oujhdtuw","videoPublishedAt":"2022-09-23T13:00:25Z","duration":"PT9M39S","dimension":"2d","definition":"hd","caption":"false","licensedContent":true,"contentRating":{},"projection":"rectangular"},"status":{"uploadStatus":"processed","privacyStatus":"public","license":"youtube","embeddable":true,"publicStatsViewable":true,"madeForKids":false}},{"kind":"youtube#video","etag":"HZEHzb80CpMll2oIURiJvSKjTGg","id":"ssL8iw5ZfJk","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2022-09-22T15:58:33Z","channelId":"UC-6OW5aJYBFM33zXQlBKPNA","title":"The repairable iPhone 14, NVIDIA’s new RTX 4000 GPUs | Engadget Podcast","description":"The repairable iPhone 14, NVIDIA’s new RTX 4000 GPUs | Engadget Podcast\n\nRead our full story on Engadget: \n\nGet More Engadget: \n• Like us on Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/engadget\n• Follow us on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/engadget\n• Follow us on Instagram: http://www.instagram.com/engadget\n• Read more: http://www.engadget.com","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ssL8iw5ZfJk/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ssL8iw5ZfJk/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ssL8iw5ZfJk/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360}},"channelTitle":"Engadget","playlistId":"UU-6OW5aJYBFM33zXQlBKPNA","position":1,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"ssL8iw5ZfJk"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Engadget","videoOwnerChannelId":"UC-6OW5aJYBFM33zXQlBKPNA","tags":["engadget","technology","consumer tech","gadgets","science","gear","tech"],"categoryId":"28","liveBroadcastContent":"none","defaultLanguage":"en","localized":{"title":"The repairable iPhone 14, NVIDIA’s new RTX 4000 GPUs | Engadget Podcast","description":"The repairable iPhone 14, NVIDIA’s new RTX 4000 GPUs | Engadget Podcast\n\nRead our full story on Engadget: \n\nGet More Engadget: \n• Like us on Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/engadget\n• Follow us on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/engadget\n• Follow us on Instagram: http://www.instagram.com/engadget\n• Read more: http://www.engadget.com"},"defaultAudioLanguage":"en"},"contentDetails":{"videoId":"ssL8iw5ZfJk","videoPublishedAt":"2022-09-22T15:58:33Z","duration":"PT1H52M18S","dimension":"2d","definition":"hd","caption":"true","licensedContent":true,"contentRating":{},"projection":"rectangular"},"status":{"uploadStatus":"processed","privacyStatus":"public","license":"youtube","embeddable":true,"publicStatsViewable":true,"madeForKids":false}},{"kind":"youtube#video","etag":"gOi2w9b3xd5edGpNABiGQrJaGfE","id":"k8SJ3S3piOY","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2022-09-22T13:00:25Z","channelId":"UC-6OW5aJYBFM33zXQlBKPNA","title":"AirPods Pro review (2022): Big changes, all on the inside","description":"Despite the unchanged design, Apple has packed an assortment of updates into the new AirPods Pro.

The new Series 8 and Watch SE look so much like last year’s Series 7 that you might struggle to tell them apart. But in fact these new models bring some less obvious changes. The most notable of these is a new temperature sensor that’s currently being used for ovulation tracking, as well as an onboard high-g accelerometer that allows for crash detection.\n\nThe company also unveiled the Watch Ultra, which was designed specifically for outdoor adventurers. The Ultra may be the most exciting smartwatch of the three, but what the new Watch SE offers for the money makes it the more interesting device in my book. Plus, Apple shaved $30 off its price, so the SE now costs $250 even though it’s basically the same as the $400 Series 8. Honestly, this feels like the smartwatch most iOS users should consider.\n\nCompared to the previous-generation Watch SE, this year’s model features a larger screen, a new processor and the aforementioned temperature sensor. If you’re considering upgrading from the older SE, the new edition will certainly feel fresh. If you’re choosing between a new SE and a Series 8, it’s less a question of what you can live without and more of how much spare cash you have. Those who don’t mind spending $150 more can buy the Series 8 for the assurance of having every feature Apple offers. Otherwise, most people will be satisfied with what the new Watch SE delivers for the money.\n\nStay tuned for full reviews of both the Apple Watch Series 8 and the 2022 Apple Watch SE.\n\nRead our preview of the Apple Watch Series 8 here: https://www.engadget.com/apple-watch-series-8-real-world-test-130031046.html\n\nRead our preview of the 2022 Apple Watch SE here: https://www.engadget.com/apple-watch-se-real-world-impressions-test-battery-life-130014165.html\n\nIf you buy something through one of our links, Engadget may earn a commission.\n\nYou can get the Apple Watch Series 8 here: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BDHM49BJ/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&linkCode=ll1&tag=buyersguide2022-20&language=en_US\n\nYou can get the 2022 Apple Watch SE here: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BDHTQDRZ/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&linkCode=ll1&tag=buyersguide2022-20&language=en_US\n\nSubscribe: https://www.youtube.com/c/Engadget \nLike us on Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/engadget\nFollow us on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/engadget\nFollow us on Instagram: http://www.instagram.com/engadget\nFollow us on TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@engadget \n\nThe Engadget Podcast: https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-engadget-podcast/id1142790530?mt=2\nMore about Engadget Audio: https://www.engadget.com/2019-08-01-engadget-podcasts.html \n\nRead more: http://www.engadget.com","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vTuKt5E18xw/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vTuKt5E18xw/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vTuKt5E18xw/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vTuKt5E18xw/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vTuKt5E18xw/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Engadget","playlistId":"UU-6OW5aJYBFM33zXQlBKPNA","position":6,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"vTuKt5E18xw"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Engadget","videoOwnerChannelId":"UC-6OW5aJYBFM33zXQlBKPNA","tags":["engadget","technology","consumer tech","gadgets","science","gear","tech","apple","apple watch","watch series 8","watch se","smartwatches","apple watch se"],"categoryId":"28","liveBroadcastContent":"none","defaultLanguage":"en","localized":{"title":"Living with the Apple Watch SE and Series 8 for a week","description":"Apple Watches are starting to look mostly the same.
