And it is so hard to believe that, a south korean brand which was once a difficult name to even pronounce, the same brand today is about to launch the biggest IPO in the History of India!!!\nIn 1996, when Hyundai entered the Indian market, Maruti was the most dominating player with a 60% market share! And amongst the middle class, maruti was almost a monopoly. But even then Hyundai came in with Santro, i10, i20 and creta and put a dent in the Indian automobile sector to an extent where today it is the second largest automarket in country with a profit of  4653 crores!! \nAnd, if you look at the profitability, Hyundai is wayyy ahead of maruti, in Fy23, while Hyundai made a profit of 65,355 Rs per vehicle, Maruti made Rs. 40,939Rs per vehicle!! So after 28 years of getting a very strong hold of the Indian market, Hyundai plans to raise 25,000 crores with its IPO!! Sounds fantastic right?? But you know what?? There are some hidden risks that Hyundai faces which may ruin all the progress that they have made in the Indian market!!  All of this is mentioned in detail in this 436 page DRHP paper that Hyundai filed with SEBI!!! So we went through all this data so that you can sit back and consume the most important bits of this 400 page document as easily as watching a movie!!!\nSo in this episode today, let's dive in to understand\nHow did a South Korean company break into the Indian automobile market leaving the tatas and mahindra's behind?\nIn Spite of being a foreign company, How did Hyundai achieve such high profitability and outpace a mammoth like Maruti in India?\nAnd most importantly, What are the hidden risks that Hyundai faces in India that can topple its growth??\nAlso guys quick disclaimer : I am not a sebi registered investment advisor and this video is not meant to give you investment advice but only to educate you about the rise of Hyundai!\n\n\nOur Best Indian Business Case Studies:\n1.

And while most of us thought this to be yet another tragic incident and we let it go, what we dont realise is that, BOEING aircrafts are still experiencing disastrous incidents that will traumatise you forever!! Look at this, In January, their door plug blew off,then they found loose bolts on door plugs, then a month later, an aircraft tyre fell off and a boeing aircraft even reported a fuel leak!!! And imagine you being mid air, and your pilot tells you that your fuel is leaking, imagine your flight just about to land, you see your tyre just fall off!! Scary as hell right???Well unfortunately this is what is happening to boeing!!!\n\nIn the past 10 years Boeing has seen 970 cases which has now put one of the greatest companies in human history at the verge of bankruptcy!!!\n\nBut you know what is the most shocking fact all guys!! Once upon a time, Boeing was by far by far the most reliable, trusted and innovative brand for 80 long years!!! Infact, boeing was so trusted that, people used to say, if aint boeing i aint going!!!\n\nBut After doing so well for 80 years, the business leaders of boeing made 1 big big mistake and that changed the fortunes of the company from a dreamrun to a nightmare!!! And as entrepreneurs, this is by far the biggest and the most common mistake that we all must avoid!!!\n\nThe question is,\nHow did boeing become the most successful company on earth only to become the biggest failure of the century??\nWhat did the leaders of boeing do wrong, because of which they lost their reputation of 80 years with this one mistake?\nAnd most importantly, what are the lessons that we need to learn from the disastrous fall of boeing!!!\n\nGuys, to understand the fall of boeing, we first need to understand that there are 2 philosophies of running a business!!! And this is one of the most important thing that even my billionaire guests have told me at the podcast!! So listen to these wise lines very very carefully!!! \n\n\nOur Best Indian Business Case Studies:\n1. Asian paints - https://youtu.be/jGT6ob8hV6M\n2. Amul - https://youtu.be/nnwqtZiYMxQ\n3.

And while most of us thought this to be yet another tragic incident and we let it go, what we dont realise is that, BOEING aircrafts are still experiencing disastrous incidents that will traumatise you forever!! Look at this, In January, their door plug blew off,then they found loose bolts on door plugs, then a month later, an aircraft tyre fell off and a boeing aircraft even reported a fuel leak!!! And imagine you being mid air, and your pilot tells you that your fuel is leaking, imagine your flight just about to land, you see your tyre just fall off!! Scary as hell right???Well unfortunately this is what is happening to boeing!!!\n\nIn the past 10 years Boeing has seen 970 cases which has now put one of the greatest companies in human history at the verge of bankruptcy!!!\n\nBut you know what is the most shocking fact all guys!! Once upon a time, Boeing was by far by far the most reliable, trusted and innovative brand for 80 long years!!! Infact, boeing was so trusted that, people used to say, if aint boeing i aint going!!!\n\nBut After doing so well for 80 years, the business leaders of boeing made 1 big big mistake and that changed the fortunes of the company from a dreamrun to a nightmare!!! And as entrepreneurs, this is by far the biggest and the most common mistake that we all must avoid!!!\n\nThe question is,\nHow did boeing become the most successful company on earth only to become the biggest failure of the century??\nWhat did the leaders of boeing do wrong, because of which they lost their reputation of 80 years with this one mistake?\nAnd most importantly, what are the lessons that we need to learn from the disastrous fall of boeing!!!\n\nGuys, to understand the fall of boeing, we first need to understand that there are 2 philosophies of running a business!!! And this is one of the most important thing that even my billionaire guests have told me at the podcast!! So listen to these wise lines very very carefully!!! \n\n\nOur Best Indian Business Case Studies:\n1. Asian paints - https://youtu.be/jGT6ob8hV6M\n2. Amul - https://youtu.be/nnwqtZiYMxQ\n3.

Robert Ballecer, tackling a wide range of thought-provoking topics, from the ethical implications of AI in sensitive fields to the challenges of creating and consuming content in an increasingly commercialized digital landscape.\n• The panel grapples with the potential risks and benefits of AI-powered therapists and priests, stressing the need for human empathy and discernment in these emotionally charged roles.\n• They confront the harsh realities of the internet's \"heat death,\" as the relentless pursuit of profits and engagement leads to a glut of low-quality content and erodes user trust.\n• The group reflects on the double-edged sword of democratized media, celebrating the value of supporting emerging voices while acknowledging the importance of professional standards.\n• As Twitter faces existential challenges, the panel surveys the social media horizon, evaluating alternative platforms like Mastodon and Bluesky, and weighing the implications of Jack Dorsey's departure from the Bluesky board.\n• Elon Musk's reckless tweets about taking Tesla private have come back to haunt him, with the Supreme Court upholding an SEC settlement requiring his Tesla-related posts to be vetted by a lawyer.\n• The FCC has cracked down on major telecom companies for the illegal sale of location data, while legislators push for reforms to prevent the government from exploiting privacy loopholes.\n• Congress continues its misguided crusade to protect children online, with ill-conceived age verification mandates and privacy-eroding measures that threaten the very foundations of digital security. The panel offers an impassioned critique of these shortsighted efforts.\n• The once-beloved video game Helldivers 2 serves as a cautionary tale of platform overreach, as a heavy-handed PlayStation Network login requirement sparks a massive player revolt and torpedoes the game's reputation.\n• Apple's quarterly results are analyzed, and all eyes are on Apple's upcoming event, where new iPads and an enhanced Apple Pencil are expected to take center stage. But the real buzz surrounds the rumored M4 chip and its tantalizing AI capabilities, hinting at a potential game-changer for the iconic brand.\n• The group geeks out over Disney+'s radical revival of X-Men '97 and Amazon's ambitious Fallout adaptation, complete with an immersive easter egg phone experience\n• The freewheeling discussion also touches on Shoshana's ingenious Alexa hacks for Sabbath TV viewing, a UK council's apostrophe apocalypse, the looming cicada invasion, and Fr.

The biggest change: Recall is actually going to be opt-in, not optional, which is what they said it would be at the launch.\n• This is a win for users and a rare example of Microsoft scaling back from dark patterns\n• Microsoft “pauses” rollout of 24H2 in the Release Preview. This is clearly tied to Recall changes - 24H2 “delayed” until June 18\n• Expect the day-one experience for Copilot+ PCs to include a big update during OOBE\n• AutoSR video game upscaling will only work on Arm-based Copilot+ PCs\n• Slack is native on Arm64\n• Arm v. Qualcomm is still a thing, could get ugly\n• /Reuters confirms Qualcomm exclusivity on WOA, says AMD and Nvidia will\noffer WOA-based chips in 2025. And now MediaTek as well.\n\nWindows 11\n• Patch Tuesday arrives. Windows 11 gets a Taskbar fix\n• Windows 11 24H2 does not get an update - delayed until next Tuesday, which is C-Day. Weird\n• New Dev and Beta builds: Snipping Tool Update that introduces automatic save for screen recordings, Narrator improvements, Share in Start search for some reason, Suggested replies in Phone Link\n• Canary: New account management interface in Start, Store improvements\n\nAI\n• Apple has its AI day in the sun\n• Apple Intelligence is coming to Mac, iPhone, iPad - on-device AI with ChatGPT-powered cloud when needed\n• Apple got right what Microsoft did not, suddenly it doesn’t look so behind\n• Key takeaway here: Microsoft’s overly aggressive AI push has always felt weird, Apple’s general approach sometimes feels plodding, but it looks like\nthey’re getting it right with AI\n• Apple Intelligence is, in many ways, Recall but with cloud component. And Google is working on its own version of Recall\n• WTF!? Microsoft is removing Custom GPT building from Copilot Pro\n• Adobe: Seriously, we’re still not training Firefly AI on your content\n• Opera provides a new AI benchmarking tool\n• DuckDuckGo AI chat will use popular AI chatbots anonymously. Like Apple with Apple Intelligence\n• NVIDIA market cap hit $3 trillion last week, surpassed Apple (until WWDC)\n\nMicrosoft 365/Cloud\n• Microsoft is killing several Outlook.com features to improve security.

The biggest change: Recall is actually going to be opt-in, not optional, which is what they said it would be at the launch.\n• This is a win for users and a rare example of Microsoft scaling back from dark patterns\n• Microsoft “pauses” rollout of 24H2 in the Release Preview. This is clearly tied to Recall changes - 24H2 “delayed” until June 18\n• Expect the day-one experience for Copilot+ PCs to include a big update during OOBE\n• AutoSR video game upscaling will only work on Arm-based Copilot+ PCs\n• Slack is native on Arm64\n• Arm v. Qualcomm is still a thing, could get ugly\n• /Reuters confirms Qualcomm exclusivity on WOA, says AMD and Nvidia will\noffer WOA-based chips in 2025. And now MediaTek as well.\n\nWindows 11\n• Patch Tuesday arrives. Windows 11 gets a Taskbar fix\n• Windows 11 24H2 does not get an update - delayed until next Tuesday, which is C-Day. Weird\n• New Dev and Beta builds: Snipping Tool Update that introduces automatic save for screen recordings, Narrator improvements, Share in Start search for some reason, Suggested replies in Phone Link\n• Canary: New account management interface in Start, Store improvements\n\nAI\n• Apple has its AI day in the sun\n• Apple Intelligence is coming to Mac, iPhone, iPad - on-device AI with ChatGPT-powered cloud when needed\n• Apple got right what Microsoft did not, suddenly it doesn’t look so behind\n• Key takeaway here: Microsoft’s overly aggressive AI push has always felt weird, Apple’s general approach sometimes feels plodding, but it looks like\nthey’re getting it right with AI\n• Apple Intelligence is, in many ways, Recall but with cloud component. And Google is working on its own version of Recall\n• WTF!? Microsoft is removing Custom GPT building from Copilot Pro\n• Adobe: Seriously, we’re still not training Firefly AI on your content\n• Opera provides a new AI benchmarking tool\n• DuckDuckGo AI chat will use popular AI chatbots anonymously. Like Apple with Apple Intelligence\n• NVIDIA market cap hit $3 trillion last week, surpassed Apple (until WWDC)\n\nMicrosoft 365/Cloud\n• Microsoft is killing several Outlook.com features to improve security. We’re going to see a lot of these SFI-justified changes\n• Patent troll sues Microsoft for Azure infringements, seeks billions\n\nXbox\n• Xbox Game Showcase!\n• Best selection of Xbox games maybe ever\n• Phil Spencer agrees Xbox needs a handheld gaming console - Plus more games coming to PS, of course\n• Microsoft announces three Xbox Series X|S refreshes.

Windows revenues from PC makers jumped 11 percent\n• Amy Hood's comment about this all happening when MSFT is investing $10+ billion per quarter on AI infrastructure and purchased Activision Blizzard (AB) for $69 is classic. This is firing on all cylinders stuff\n\nMore Earnings Learnings\n• Intel: The deathwatch continues\n• AMD: Meager revenue gains, but PC market is looking OK at least\n• Google/Alphabet: Explosive revenues, but its all ADs not AI\n• Amazon: A wonder of the modern age, unique physical + digital advantages\n• Samsung: Revenues up on strong phone, memory sales\n\nWindows 11\n• Windows 11 version 24H2 will include an AI Explorer feature. Will require NPUs/AI PCs. Might be exclusive to Qualcomm but that would be a huge mistake, seems unlikely. Runs in the background, captures everything you do, turns them into memories. Search for anything you’ve done using natural language (i.e. a chatbot interface). Analyze and interact with everything that’s currently on screen.  \n• Beta channel (sooner than 24H2) - improved widgets for some reason, File Explorer ”breadcrumbs” make a much-needed comeback, Show Desktop is back, baby\n• Dev channel - Starting with the latest build, Microsoft has killed all the local account workarounds during Setup workarounds. Now what?\n• Tiny11 Builder is updated with telemetry removal. It’s happening.\n\nMicrosoft 365\n• Microsoft highlights new Copilot features for Microsoft 365 available now or soon\n• OneDrive for web gets offline access (including Files on Demand), but only for commercial accounts\n\nAI\n• Email evidence shows why Microsoft partnered with OpenAI\n• ChatGPT can now “remember” conversations. It’s sentient!\n• Amazon Q is GA, and it’s for developers now too\n• Microsoft announces GitHub Copilot Workspace and my brain hurts. Please help\n• Apple is shopping around for AI and is talking to OpenAI again\n\nXbox\n• Xbox Showcase returns on June 9, with mystery event that is obviously the next Call of Duty: Black Ops game because redacted\n• Microsoft announces new Game Pass titles for early May. Guess what’s missing? You have one guess, hotshot.

Windows revenues from PC makers jumped 11 percent\n• Amy Hood's comment about this all happening when MSFT is investing $10+ billion per quarter on AI infrastructure and purchased Activision Blizzard (AB) for $69 is classic. This is firing on all cylinders stuff\n\nMore Earnings Learnings\n• Intel: The deathwatch continues\n• AMD: Meager revenue gains, but PC market is looking OK at least\n• Google/Alphabet: Explosive revenues, but its all ADs not AI\n• Amazon: A wonder of the modern age, unique physical + digital advantages\n• Samsung: Revenues up on strong phone, memory sales\n\nWindows 11\n• Windows 11 version 24H2 will include an AI Explorer feature. Will require NPUs/AI PCs. Might be exclusive to Qualcomm but that would be a huge mistake, seems unlikely. Runs in the background, captures everything you do, turns them into memories. Search for anything you’ve done using natural language (i.e. a chatbot interface). Analyze and interact with everything that’s currently on screen.  \n• Beta channel (sooner than 24H2) - improved widgets for some reason, File Explorer ”breadcrumbs” make a much-needed comeback, Show Desktop is back, baby\n• Dev channel - Starting with the latest build, Microsoft has killed all the local account workarounds during Setup workarounds. Now what?\n• Tiny11 Builder is updated with telemetry removal. It’s happening.\n\nMicrosoft 365\n• Microsoft highlights new Copilot features for Microsoft 365 available now or soon\n• OneDrive for web gets offline access (including Files on Demand), but only for commercial accounts\n\nAI\n• Email evidence shows why Microsoft partnered with OpenAI\n• ChatGPT can now “remember” conversations. It’s sentient!\n• Amazon Q is GA, and it’s for developers now too\n• Microsoft announces GitHub Copilot Workspace and my brain hurts. Please help\n• Apple is shopping around for AI and is talking to OpenAI again\n\nXbox\n• Xbox Showcase returns on June 9, with mystery event that is obviously the next Call of Duty: Black Ops game because redacted\n• Microsoft announces new Game Pass titles for early May. Guess what’s missing? You have one guess, hotshot. And seriously, haven’t we all played every Tomb Raider game already?\n• Microsoft’s latest indie game showcase highlights the health of an ecosystem that doesn’t have to just be about AAA games\n• Sea of Thieves comes to PlayStation 5\n• Food for thought: Microsoft bought AB in October, has released only on AB title to Game Pass in what will soon be 7 months.
