an alphabet preserve a culture?","description":"The language of the Fulani people of West Africa, known as Pulaar, is spoken by over 40 million people, but for most of history, the language had no alphabet. Determined to preserve their native language since they were children, the Barry brothers created ADLaM, a handwritten alphabet for their people.\n \nYet the need remained to digitize the alphabet so it could be used to communicate in the modern digital world, empowering the Fulani people to conduct business, connect through social media and find information in their own language.\n \nThough the brothers had developed early versions of the digital typeface, for the Fulani community to fully adopt and embrace it, the alphabet needed to be optimized and made more widely available in digital spaces. In partnership with the brothers and a group of expert typeface designers we created a revised version of the alphabet that was easier to read and write. Importantly, the new typeface was updated to include new letter forms that take into account how the alphabet has naturally evolved within the Fulani community.\n \nMicrosoft has now integrated the redesigned alphabet across their global platforms. The revised version of the alphabet is now available to download on unlocked.microsoft.com as the ADLaM Display font and will be deployed natively across the Microsoft 365 suite of programs, desktop and mobile.\n\nSubscribe to Microsoft on YouTube here: https://aka.ms/SubscribeToYouTube\r\n\r\nFollow us on social: \r\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/microsoft/ \r\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Microsoft\r\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/Microsoft/ \r\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/microsoft/ \r\n \r\nFor more about Microsoft, our technology, and our mission, visit https://aka.ms/microsoftstories","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1GRTS2sFqhY/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1GRTS2sFqhY/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1GRTS2sFqhY/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1GRTS2sFqhY/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1GRTS2sFqhY/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Microsoft","playlistId":"UUFtEEv80fQVKkD4h1PF-Xqw","position":4,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"1GRTS2sFqhY"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Microsoft","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCFtEEv80fQVKkD4h1PF-Xqw","categoryId":"28","liveBroadcastContent":"none","defaultLanguage":"en","localized":{"title":"Can an alphabet preserve a culture?","description":"The language of the Fulani people of West Africa, known as Pulaar, is spoken by over 40 million people, but for most of history, the language had no alphabet.

And go figure, but this time the rollout went as planned and was (mostly) communicated correctly.\n• Users with eligible PCs running Windows 11 version 22H2 can install the February 2023 optional non-security preview release today by visiting Windows Update settings and selecting Check for updates. The update will then become \"officially\" available on March 14, 2023 (Patch Tuesday).\n• Search (Taskbar). Can be configured to hide, icon only, icon and label (pill), search box. Bing AI integration in search so you can start a chat from your PC desktop. (It opens in the browser.) Check this out, it uses your default browser! But the Bing AI integration is non-existent. \n• Updated UX for notification area (formerly system tray) - can now arrange the icons, including those in the hidden pop-up.\n• Touch-optimized Taskbar for 2-in-1s. Automatic when keyboard removed.\n• File Explorer: Faster search and recommended local and cloud files in Home.\n• Notepad has tabs.\n• AI-powered recommended content (files) in Start for managed orgs only.\n• Full-screen widgets.\n• Windows 365 app is now GA in the Store.\n• Coming soon: iPhone integration with the Phone Link app. Messages (with limitations, not true iMessage), phone calls, notifications.\n• Windows Studio Effects - Find and adjust quick settings (eye contact, background blur, voice focus, and automatic framing) directly from the taskbar.

And go figure, but this time the rollout went as planned and was (mostly) communicated correctly.\n• Users with eligible PCs running Windows 11 version 22H2 can install the February 2023 optional non-security preview release today by visiting Windows Update settings and selecting Check for updates. The update will then become \"officially\" available on March 14, 2023 (Patch Tuesday).\n• Search (Taskbar). Can be configured to hide, icon only, icon and label (pill), search box. Bing AI integration in search so you can start a chat from your PC desktop. (It opens in the browser.) Check this out, it uses your default browser! But the Bing AI integration is non-existent. \n• Updated UX for notification area (formerly system tray) - can now arrange the icons, including those in the hidden pop-up.\n• Touch-optimized Taskbar for 2-in-1s. Automatic when keyboard removed.\n• File Explorer: Faster search and recommended local and cloud files in Home.\n• Notepad has tabs.\n• AI-powered recommended content (files) in Start for managed orgs only.\n• Full-screen widgets.\n• Windows 365 app is now GA in the Store.\n• Coming soon: iPhone integration with the Phone Link app. Messages (with limitations, not true iMessage), phone calls, notifications.\n• Windows Studio Effects - Find and adjust quick settings (eye contact, background blur, voice focus, and automatic framing) directly from the taskbar. Requires an NPU.\n• Snipping Tool enhancements – Built-in screen recorder with autosave functionality\n• Energy use recommendations – Greater control over defaults plus tips to help decrease energy usage\n• New accessibility features – Seamless switching between Narrator and other screen readers when using braille display; voice commands work across apps and File Explorer\n• After 18 months of Windows 11, one thing is clear: Windows 11 is designed almost exclusively for consumers, not business users, and this (and the lack of an LTSC version) explains why the enterprise has ignored this release so far.\n\nWindows 11\n• Paul finally had a chance to test Windows 11 on Arm in Parallels Desktop on the Mac in multiple configurations\n• Because it dumps an ISO in your Downloads folder, Paul was able to rescue a WOA-based PC from the Insider Program\n• Microsoft offers Windows Insiders in Beta a temporary “off-ramp” (read: magic window) to get out of the program\n• HP reported an 18.8 percent revenue decline in most recent quarter.
