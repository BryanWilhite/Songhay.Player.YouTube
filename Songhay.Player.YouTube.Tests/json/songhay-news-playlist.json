Flight data from a test campaign with a Colomban MC-30 Luciole showed a drop in measured vertical g-loads from 0.4 g to 0.1 g, and root mean square acceleration reduced from 1.31 m/s² to below 0.39 m/s².\n\nThe company aims to get this system onto larger aircraft like airliners and business jets.

Developed by S-92 lessor Milestone Aviation in cooperation with operator VIH Helicopters, it marks the first such-configured S-92 available to the commercial market.\n\nThe program was launched last summer in British Columbia with the assistance of government wildfire management agencies.\n\nAccording to the companies, this S-92A has the capacity to carry up to 19 passengers, internal/external cargo, or 5,000 liters (1,320 gallons) of water in the expandable belly-mounted custom-built Helitak carbon fiber tank. The external tank weighs less than 700 pounds empty and is supplemental type certificated for the large-cabin helicopter. With its snorkel, it can fully fill from a body of water in just 48 seconds and can be removed from the helicopter in less than 30 minutes.\n\nOther features include a lighter cabin interior, bubble window on the pilot side to enable more precise water drops and increased visibility when refilling, and exterior power gauge mounted just below this window for use during refilling.\n\nVIH Aerospace is performing the reconfiguration in-house, a process that takes approximately four months. COO Jen Norie noted it has received a lot of interest in the conversion, and VIH expects to have three converted S-92s operational by the third quarter.\n\n“We’re seeing these wonderful aircraft coming off of the offshore service after 20 years still with lots of life left in them, and so that’s why we’re doing this program to reconfigure them,” said Norie, who sees this as a growing product line for the company. “There’s going to be more and more of them—it’s going to be the future of the business.”\n\nThere are currently more than 260 S-92s in service. Its airframe has a life-limit of 30,000 hours, according to Leon Silva, Sikorsky’s v-p of global commercial and military systems.\n\n“We expect that the customer’s will keep the [S-92] aircraft in the high utilization missions for example, offshore where they are flying 1,500-to 2,000 hours a year and then when the aircraft gets close to the end of its life, then you are flying a couple hundred hours a year with one of these and then use it for another 10 years,” Silva told AIN.\n\n___________________________________________________\n\nVisit http://www.ainonline.com for all the latest on the aviation industry, and *AIN* sister site http://bjtonline.com for the most comprehensive resource available for anyone using—or interested in trying—private flight.

            "description": "Cirrus has announced the launch of the new SR series G7+, the first piston-single aircraft to be equipped with Garmin’s Safe Return Emergency Autoland system.\n\nFor use in emergency situations such as pilot incapacitation, the Collier Award-winning system will assume control of the in-flight aircraft at the touch of a button, transmit emergency alerts to air traffic control, navigate to the nearest suitable airport, and land autonomously, all the while issuing instructions and status updates to passengers via the aircraft’s cockpit data screens. The system will then bring the aircraft to a stop on the runway center line, shut down the engine, and instruct occupants when it is safe to exit.\n\nIn instances where the pilot is the lone occupant, Safe Return will passively monitor their flight patterns, and if it detects an erratic or dangerous operation, it will first query the pilot before assuming control and landing the airplane. If a pilot regains the ability to safely aviate, they can disengage the system at any point.\n\nSafe Return is now standard equipment on all new-build Cirrus SR Series G7+ airplanes, part of an upgrade suite that also includes automatic database updates powered by Cirrus IQ Pro, runway occupancy awareness, and smart pitot heat.\n\nAutoland was first approved for use by the FAA in the Piper M600 SLS turboprop single in 2020, followed by the Daher TBM 940 (since proceeded by the TBM 960), Cirrus SF50 Vision Jet, and Beechcraft King Air 200 and 300-series turboprop twins.\n\nCirrus brings the technology to an “entry-level” piston aircraft for the first time, exposing a wider set of pilots and passengers to this technology.\n\n___________________________________________________\n\nVisit http://www.ainonline.com for all the latest on the aviation industry, and *AIN* sister site http://bjtonline.com for the most comprehensive resource available for anyone using—or interested in trying—private flight.

              "description": "Cirrus has announced the launch of the new SR series G7+, the first piston-single aircraft to be equipped with Garmin’s Safe Return Emergency Autoland system.\n\nFor use in emergency situations such as pilot incapacitation, the Collier Award-winning system will assume control of the in-flight aircraft at the touch of a button, transmit emergency alerts to air traffic control, navigate to the nearest suitable airport, and land autonomously, all the while issuing instructions and status updates to passengers via the aircraft’s cockpit data screens. The system will then bring the aircraft to a stop on the runway center line, shut down the engine, and instruct occupants when it is safe to exit.\n\nIn instances where the pilot is the lone occupant, Safe Return will passively monitor their flight patterns, and if it detects an erratic or dangerous operation, it will first query the pilot before assuming control and landing the airplane. If a pilot regains the ability to safely aviate, they can disengage the system at any point.\n\nSafe Return is now standard equipment on all new-build Cirrus SR Series G7+ airplanes, part of an upgrade suite that also includes automatic database updates powered by Cirrus IQ Pro, runway occupancy awareness, and smart pitot heat.\n\nAutoland was first approved for use by the FAA in the Piper M600 SLS turboprop single in 2020, followed by the Daher TBM 940 (since proceeded by the TBM 960), Cirrus SF50 Vision Jet, and Beechcraft King Air 200 and 300-series turboprop twins.\n\nCirrus brings the technology to an “entry-level” piston aircraft for the first time, exposing a wider set of pilots and passengers to this technology.\n\n___________________________________________________\n\nVisit http://www.ainonline.com for all the latest on the aviation industry, and *AIN* sister site http://bjtonline.com for the most comprehensive resource available for anyone using—or interested in trying—private flight.

Here's how we think it could be incorporated into our build workflow, and why it's such a unique fabrication machine. \n\nLearn more about the EufyMake E1 UV printer: https://anker-1.kckb.me/a4fff570\n\nShot by Joey Fameli and edited by Norman Chan\nMusic by Jinglepunks\n\nSubscribe for more videos (and click the bell for notifications):  http://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=testedcom\n\nJoin this channel to support Tested and get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiDJtJKMICpb9B1qf7qjEOA/join\nTested and Adam Savage Ts, stickers, (de) merit badges and more: https://tested-store.com\nAbout Tested: https://www.tested.com/about\nMeet Adam in Person: https://www.tested.com/events\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@testedcom\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/testedcom/\nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/testedcom\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/testedcom\nDiscord: https://www.discord.gg/tested\nAmazon Storefront: http://www.amazon.com/shop/adamsavagestested\nAudio Described and Accessible Videos: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJtitKU0CAeiQLgj4PZ9onSW6YXIz5ADR\n\nIntro bumper by Abe Dieckman\n\nThanks for watching!\n\n#uvprinter #firstlook #3dprinting"

It ditches modern features like RAW, EVF and stabilization in favor of film-like charm, a small 1-inch sensor, built-in filters, and a digital “film advance” lever.

Here’s what it’s like to use.\n\n00:00 Intro \n00:32 Hardware and design\n01:39 Image quality and photo samples\n02:31 New modes: Diptychs and Film Mode\n03:25 Film filters\n04:27 Video sample\n04:57 The downsides \n05:50 Cameras are fun again!

              "description": "Fujifilm’s new X Half camera is quirky, limited, and kind of fascinating. It ditches modern features like RAW, EVF and stabilization in favor of film-like charm, a small 1-inch sensor, built-in filters, and a digital “film advance” lever. It’s not for everyone — (mainly because of its price) but if you love capturing scrappy, spontaneous moments, this might be your new favorite camera. Here’s what it’s like to use.\n\n00:00 Intro \n00:32 Hardware and design\n01:39 Image quality and photo samples\n02:31 New modes: Diptychs and Film Mode\n03:25 Film filters\n04:27 Video sample\n04:57 The downsides \n05:50 Cameras are fun again!

Do you realise that’s more than the combined populations of the United States, Russia, and Germany? All of them disconnected from education, jobs, healthcare, and the digital economy.\nAnd this isn’t a new problem. Even after Jio revolutionised mobile data, and Airtel built one of the largest telecom networks in Asia, until now, 50% of the Indian population is not connected to the internet!!\nSo now, in cities—while we’re streaming in 4K—in villages, students are still waiting for the page to buffer. In corporate boardrooms, while we’re talking about Metaverse meetings…\nIn the villages, even a Zoom call feels like science fiction. And we’re building unicorns in Bangalore… there are kids in Bihar who’ve never used YouTube. And while we in privileged cities complain if our Wi-Fi drops for 5 seconds…\nMillions of people today haven’t experienced Wi-Fi at all.\nBut now, Elon Musk is about to bring something revolutionary for India!!! Starlink is joining hands with Jio and Airtel to bring the internet to the last corners of India. Not with towers. Not with cables. But with satellites, from space.\nAnd if this works? It won’t just bring internet—it could spark the next chapter in India’s growth story Just like the Green Revolution fed a hungry nation, Just like the telecom boom gave every Indian a voice…\nThis could be the moment where rural India comes online to participate in India’s next growth chapter!!\nAnd that brings us to 3 BIG questions:\nWhy couldn’t Jio and Airtel solve India’s last-mile problem, even after slashing internet prices by 96%?\n\nWhat makes Starlink’s technology so powerful that it might finally succeed where everyone else failed?\n\nAnd most importantly: what new industries, businesses, and billion-dollar opportunities will be born if this actually works?\n\n\nOur Best Indian Business Case Studies:\n1.

Do you realise that’s more than the combined populations of the United States, Russia, and Germany? All of them disconnected from education, jobs, healthcare, and the digital economy.\nAnd this isn’t a new problem. Even after Jio revolutionised mobile data, and Airtel built one of the largest telecom networks in Asia, until now, 50% of the Indian population is not connected to the internet!!\nSo now, in cities—while we’re streaming in 4K—in villages, students are still waiting for the page to buffer. In corporate boardrooms, while we’re talking about Metaverse meetings…\nIn the villages, even a Zoom call feels like science fiction. And we’re building unicorns in Bangalore… there are kids in Bihar who’ve never used YouTube. And while we in privileged cities complain if our Wi-Fi drops for 5 seconds…\nMillions of people today haven’t experienced Wi-Fi at all.\nBut now, Elon Musk is about to bring something revolutionary for India!!! Starlink is joining hands with Jio and Airtel to bring the internet to the last corners of India. Not with towers. Not with cables. But with satellites, from space.\nAnd if this works? It won’t just bring internet—it could spark the next chapter in India’s growth story Just like the Green Revolution fed a hungry nation, Just like the telecom boom gave every Indian a voice…\nThis could be the moment where rural India comes online to participate in India’s next growth chapter!!\nAnd that brings us to 3 BIG questions:\nWhy couldn’t Jio and Airtel solve India’s last-mile problem, even after slashing internet prices by 96%?\n\nWhat makes Starlink’s technology so powerful that it might finally succeed where everyone else failed?\n\nAnd most importantly: what new industries, businesses, and billion-dollar opportunities will be born if this actually works?\n\n\nOur Best Indian Business Case Studies:\n1.

The man who stepped out was none other than Amitabh Bachchan, the biggest star of India. This wasn’t Baskin Robbins.This wasn’t Amul. This was a shop with no ads, no marketing budget and no fancy consultants—just fresh Sitaphal, mango pulp, and one man’s obsession with flavour. \n\nWhat followed next, was the story of one of India’s greatest brand stories ever told!!! This is the story of how the son of a fruit seller with no MBA,No business plan and No investors and yet, he gave billion-dollar brands like HUL, Amul, and Baskin Robbins a run for their money. In the battle field of the ice cream industry, this man built a cash machine that makes ₹300 crore..\nThis is the story of Naturals Ice Cream.\n\nSo the question is:\n\n- What made legends like Amitabh Bachchan show up in person?\n- How did Naturals survive a war against Amul, HUL, and Baskin Robbins —without ads and investment?\n- And what can you learn from this legendary story?\n\nOur Best Indian Business Case Studies:\n1.

The man who stepped out was none other than Amitabh Bachchan, the biggest star of India. This wasn’t Baskin Robbins.This wasn’t Amul. This was a shop with no ads, no marketing budget and no fancy consultants—just fresh Sitaphal, mango pulp, and one man’s obsession with flavour. \n\nWhat followed next, was the story of one of India’s greatest brand stories ever told!!! This is the story of how the son of a fruit seller with no MBA,No business plan and No investors and yet, he gave billion-dollar brands like HUL, Amul, and Baskin Robbins a run for their money. In the battle field of the ice cream industry, this man built a cash machine that makes ₹300 crore..\nThis is the story of Naturals Ice Cream.\n\nSo the question is:\n\n- What made legends like Amitabh Bachchan show up in person?\n- How did Naturals survive a war against Amul, HUL, and Baskin Robbins —without ads and investment?\n- And what can you learn from this legendary story?\n\nOur Best Indian Business Case Studies:\n1.

And 2 of these glorified initiatives are the ONDC and OCEN initiative!!!\nThese 2 initiatives have failed so badly that ONDC's app is worse than a college student’s first-year project and OCEN has been ignored by the biggest banking players of the country!!\nAnd the reason why we are making a video on this failure is because 2 years ago, we ourselves made a video on how revolutionary this initiative was!!!

            "description": "It’s go time: The biggest Patch Tuesday of 2025 sets the stage for 2025! Microsoft has finally revealed whether it will further extend Windows 10 support past October (it won't). Also, Microsoft designed notifications in Windows 11 to be annoying and pointless, so Paul has some advice. Plus, Proton Drive gets a long awaited albums feature, and more on the way.\n\nWindows 11\n• Recall (preview) and Click to Do (preview) come to stable for the first time\n• Let’s give Microsoft a bit of credit for this one non-reported behavior\n• Also: Improvements to Settings, Narrator, Start, Phone Link, Widgets, File Explorer\n• You knew this was coming: Microsoft now testing a “Hey, Copilot” feature\n• It’s opt-in and an alternative to holding down Alt + Spacebar for two seconds\n• Microsoft discusses the new Start design and it’s not a s#$t show like it was three years ago\n• No builds for the second Friday in a row\n• Improvements to Settings AI agent, intelligent text actions in Click to Do, a few small changes come to 24H2 in Dev and Beta channels\n• Copilot Vision gets Highlights and 2-App Support across all channels\n• Google’s big Android reveal includes Material Expressive, big Wear OS update. Android, like Windows 11 (and iOS) is just being updated all the time now\n\nWindows 10\n• Extended support program\n• Will support Microsoft 365 on Windows 10 through October 2028\n• Those time frames are identical\n• So what about those Surface PCs that can’t upgrade to Windows 11? Microsoft has an answer (for all unsupported PCs) and it’s not as cynical as you think\n• Microsoft quietly discontinued entry-level 13.8-inch Surface Laptop and 13-inch Surface Pro when it introduced those smaller new models last week\n\nLayoffs\n• Microsoft just made $70 billion, so naturally it’s laying off employees. How to explain this?\n• The FTC’s losing streak against Microsoft continues\n• A proposal for solving the “Mozilla problem” in U.S. v. Google\n• Fortnite could return to the iPhone App Store as soon as today\n\nAI\n• OH MY GOD IS THERE NO AI NEWS FOR ONCE. OK, three small items\n• OpenAI brings OneDrive and SharePoint integration with ChatGPT for paid business customers\n• “AI mode” could replace “I’m feeling lucky” on the Google home page\n• Spotify’s AI DJ keeps improving\n\nDev\n• Build is next week in Seattle, a few thoughts\n• .NET 10 Preview 4 is out\n\nXbox & Games\n• Today’s the day: DOOM: The Dark Ages goes live at 8:00 ET tonight!\n• Xbox Insiders can now play cloud-enabled games with mouse and keyboard\n• Paul reviews the Backbone Pro controller\n• Nintendo revenues slide big ahead of Switch 2 - 15m consoles expected in first year\n• Sony sold 18.5 million PS5s in the most recent fiscal year, down 11 percent YOY\n\nTips & Picks\n• Tip of the week: Windows 11 notifications make iOS look sophisticated\n• App pick of the week: Proton Drive\n• RunAs Radio this week: Active Directory in 2025 with Liz Tesch\n• Brown liquor pick of the week: Limeburners Albany Tawny Cask\n\nHosts: Leo Laporte, Paul Thurrott, and Richard Campbell\nWindows Weekly episode 932\nMore Info: https://twit.tv/shows/windows-weekly/episodes/932\n\nSponsors:\n• 1password.com/windowsweekly\n• threatlocker.com/twit\n• uscloud.com\n\nDownload or subscribe to Windows Weekly at https://twit.tv/shows/windows-weekly\n\nCheck out Paul's blog at thurrott.com\n\nThe Windows Weekly theme music is courtesy of Carl Franklin.\n\nJoin Club TWiT for Ad-Free Podcasts!\nSupport what you love and get ad-free shows, a members-only Discord, and behind-the-scenes access.

Plus, Proton Drive gets a long awaited albums feature, and more on the way.\n\nWindows 11\n• Recall (preview) and Click to Do (preview) come to stable for the first time\n• Let’s give Microsoft a bit of credit for this one non-reported behavior\n• Also: Improvements to Settings, Narrator, Start, Phone Link, Widgets, File Explorer\n• You knew this was coming: Microsoft now testing a “Hey, Copilot” feature\n• It’s opt-in and an alternative to holding down Alt + Spacebar for two seconds\n• Microsoft discusses the new Start design and it’s not a s#$t show like it was three years ago\n• No builds for the second Friday in a row\n• Improvements to Settings AI agent, intelligent text actions in Click to Do, a few small changes come to 24H2 in Dev and Beta channels\n• Copilot Vision gets Highlights and 2-App Support across all channels\n• Google’s big Android reveal includes Material Expressive, big Wear OS update.

How to explain this?\n• The FTC’s losing streak against Microsoft continues\n• A proposal for solving the “Mozilla problem” in U.S. v.
