Now although they deescalted their conflict, all the root causes of their conflict still remain the same which means, there is again a possibility of an Iran Pakistan conflict, especially because pakistan’s election is very very close! And you will be shocked to know that, in 1965 and 1971 war, Iran was actually pakistan’s best friend who supplied both weapons and money against India!!

Similarly, for Iran, its already at war with the west because of the red sea conflict!! Now although they deescalted their conflict, all the root causes of their conflict still remain the same which means, there is again a possibility of an Iran Pakistan conflict, especially because pakistan’s election is very very close! And you will be shocked to know that, in 1965 and 1971 war, Iran was actually pakistan’s best friend who supplied both weapons and money against India!! But today, while Iran is a close friend of India, it an arch enenemy of pakistan!!! This is because of India’s genius non alignment strategy!! So this case study teaches us some very important lessons in geopolitics that every nation must learn from and more importantly it also teaches how united states creates a conflict and escapes the crime like a wizard!!\n\nSo the question, \n\nWhy did  Iran and Pakistan launch missiles on each other?\n\nHow did they go from being best friends to becoming arch enemies?\n\nAnd what are the lessons that this geopolitical conflict has to teach to India and the world?\n\n✅Study Materials:\n\nhttps://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/express-view-on-iran-pakistan-conflict-step-back-from-brink-9116239/\n\nhttps://indianexpress.com/article/explained/iran-pakistan-and-the-baloch-militancy-9116284/\n\nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-11-23/iran-s-poverty-spread-in-lost-decade-of-sanctions-oil-swings-world-bank-says\n\nhttps://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/iran-pakistan-strikes-why-indias-stakes-deepen-9116100/\n\nhttps://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/jaa-blf-bla-who-are-the-militant-groups-iran-pakistan-have-hit-in-cross-border-strikes-9116282/\n\n\nThink School is a Digital School that we all deserved, but never had\n►►Check out Think School's Online courses: https://www.thethinkschool.com\n\n#pakistan #pakistanarmy #iranvspakistan \n\n#thinkschool #businesscasestudy #geopolitics"},"defaultAudioLanguage":"en"},"contentDetails":{"videoId":"HtUiNw8K3XE","videoPublishedAt":"2024-01-23T15:30:08Z","duration":"PT17M11S","dimension":"2d","definition":"hd","caption":"false","licensedContent":true,"contentRating":{},"projection":"rectangular"},"status":{"uploadStatus":"processed","privacyStatus":"public","license":"youtube","embeddable":true,"publicStatsViewable":true,"madeForKids":false}},{"kind":"youtube#video","etag":"PZo4zaBgcmFMVoyWijrpiV6-EX0","id":"eCoOsDrbics","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2024-01-19T13:30:07Z","channelId":"UCKZozRVHRYsYHGEyNKuhhdA","title":"Why Gujarat’s Gift City is a GAME CHANGER for INDIA? : Economic Case Study","description":"⭐️ Think School’s flagship Communication course with an exclusive workshop on Chat GPT included: \nhttps://thethinkschool.com/sp/communication-masterclass/\n\nVIDEO INTRODUCTION:\n\nZero tax policy is one of the most lucarative and perhaps the most controverisal policy in the 21st century, and while countries like UAE and Qatar have used their oil money to nullify their taxes, in India zero taxes is something that nobody could ever  expect!!

They debate AI and tech’s impact on society, discuss the ups and downs of companies like Twitter, Apple, and SpaceX, reminisce about the early days of computing and the Internet, and more, all with good humor and insight gained from decades in tech.\n\nTopics Discussed:\n• The explosion of AI in 2023, from chatbots like ChatGPT to powerful new AI demonstrations. Debate on whether we’re nearing AGI (artificial general intelligence) and the societal impacts.\n• The rise and struggles of companies like Facebook/Meta, Netflix, Twitter, Alibaba. Patterns of tech success, failure, and Corey Doctorow's concept of \"ensh*tification.\"\n• Elon Musk: The good (SpaceX, Starlink), bad (Twitter), and unpredictable. Is he still an innovator or has wealth and power corrupted him?\n• Open source, Linux, and big tech’s relationship to open ecosystems. Concerns about commercialization diluting open ideals.\n• Looking back on early tech days. How the history of tech contextualizes what’s happening today. Nostalgia and optimism for the early Internet days.\n• The revival of space exploration, privatized today by SpaceX and others. What can we expect as we (hopefully) return to the Moon in 2024?\n• Chaos, unpredictability, and the feeling of societal flux as we head into 2024. An uncertain but interesting future awaits.\n\nMemorable Quotes:\n• \"AI is only dangerous to humans if you give it physical agency in the real world. Combine AI with a robotic dog, and now you got something.\" - Leo\n• \"When are you getting your stupid thing that you wear that has the laser on your hand?\" - Jeff to Leo \n• \"It's time to hand it over. We're effing up the world. We've done it for centuries. It's time to hand it over.\" - Jeff on tech leadership \n• \"So has anybody played with the Apple ones that have the weird eyeballs?\" - Doc on Apple's augmented reality efforts\n• \"Chaos is a weird thing. You could have your faucet dripping slowly and almost all of the drips go down and land and that's it, but somehow about a yard off to the one side is a drip\" - Steve on increasing chaos\n\nHost: Leo Laporte\nGuests: Jeff Jarvis, Doc Searls, Steve Gibson, and Rod Pyle\nThis Week in Tech episode 959\nMore Info: https://twit.tv/shows/this-week-in-tech/episodes/959\n\nSponsors:\n• rocketmoney.com/twit\n• gusto.com/tech\n• Stamps.com promo code TWiT\n• hid.link/twitdemo\n\nDownload or subscribe to this show at https://twit.tv/shows/this-week-in-tech\n\nGet episodes ad-free with Club TWiT at https://twit.tv/clubtwit\n\nProducts we recommend: https://www.amazon.com/shop/twitnetcastnetwork\nTWiT may earn commissions on certain products.\n\nFollow us:\nhttps://twit.tv/\nhttps://twitter.com/TWiT\nhttps://www.facebook.com/TWiTNetwork\nhttps://www.instagram.com/twit.tv/\n\nAbout us:\nTWiT.tv is a technology podcasting network located in the San Francisco Bay Area with the #1 ranked technology podcast This Week in Tech hosted by Leo Laporte.
