Creating hundreds of different digital wallets causes a vendor lock-in which leads to a lack of interoperability and functionality amongst services. Meanwhile, the fragmentation of their design and development means that the security of these wallets is not always as strong as it could be.\n\nThe Open Wallet Foundation (OWF) was formed to support the development of wallets that are portable, secure, and that anyone can use on any device, with any operating system, for any app or service, and with any currency. This whitepaper traces the origins of digital wallets, the opportunities and obstacles in this area of development, and where the OWF comes in. \n\nRead the full report: https://www.linuxfoundation.org/research/open-wallet-foundation?hsLang=en"},"defaultAudioLanguage":"en"},"contentDetails":{"videoId":"spwHNuZGiDk","videoPublishedAt":"2023-02-27T21:20:59Z","duration":"PT1M28S","dimension":"2d","definition":"hd","caption":"false","licensedContent":false,"contentRating":{},"projection":"rectangular"},"status":{"uploadStatus":"processed","privacyStatus":"public","license":"youtube","embeddable":true,"publicStatsViewable":true,"madeForKids":false}},{"kind":"youtube#video","etag":"Myilu7l0Vp9s0PrZljPhM3_Lg08","id":"09WF3zZBcCk","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2023-02-24T16:26:40Z","channelId":"UCfX55Sx5hEFjoC3cNs6mCUQ","title":"OpenWallet Foundation Officially Launched | Interview With Founder Daniel Goldscheider","description":"Learn more here: https://openwallet.foundation/\nThe OWF is a consortium of companies and non-profit organisations collaborating to drive global adoption of open, secure and interoperable digital wallet solutions as well as providing access to expertise and advice through our Government Advisory Council.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/09WF3zZBcCk/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/09WF3zZBcCk/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/09WF3zZBcCk/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/09WF3zZBcCk/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/09WF3zZBcCk/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"The Linux Foundation","playlistId":"UUfX55Sx5hEFjoC3cNs6mCUQ","position":6,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"09WF3zZBcCk"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"The Linux Foundation","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCfX55Sx5hEFjoC3cNs6mCUQ","categoryId":"28","liveBroadcastContent":"none","localized":{"title":"OpenWallet Foundation Officially Launched | Interview With Founder Daniel Goldscheider","description":"Learn more here: https://openwallet.foundation/\nThe OWF is a consortium of companies and non-profit organisations collaborating to drive global adoption of open, secure and interoperable digital wallet solutions as well as providing access to expertise and advice through our Government Advisory Council."},"defaultAudioLanguage":"en"},"contentDetails":{"videoId":"09WF3zZBcCk","videoPublishedAt":"2023-02-24T16:26:40Z","duration":"PT13M44S","dimension":"2d","definition":"hd","caption":"false","licensedContent":false,"contentRating":{},"projection":"rectangular"},"status":{"uploadStatus":"processed","privacyStatus":"public","license":"creativeCommon","embeddable":true,"publicStatsViewable":true,"madeForKids":false}},{"kind":"youtube#video","etag":"QCixR9YOhD1VgVLduZyY0a0ohxA","id":"e1cdZ_Nzo_U","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2023-02-23T17:32:44Z","channelId":"UCfX55Sx5hEFjoC3cNs6mCUQ","title":"OpenWallet Foundation Launch: The Future of Digital Wallets","description":"Why and How Open Source Communities Will Drive Collaboration and Development of Digital Asset Custody and Interoperability\n\nAs our world becomes increasingly digitized, the same holds true for everyday assets.

The short cable that wasn’t an issue for a Model 3 might make charging another EV a pain. Also, good luck finding a station near you. Even in the EV-heavy Bay Area we had to travel two hours to find a station that supported non-Teslas. \n\nThat said, we hopped into the BMW ix M60 and took a road trip to see if Tesla’s ability to build a robust charging network for its own vehicle translates into something that it can do for the rest of the industry. \n\nSubscribe: https://www.youtube.com/c/Engadget \nLike us on Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/engadget\nFollow us on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/engadget\nFollow us on Instagram: http://www.instagram.com/engadget\nFollow us on TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@engadget \n\nThe Engadget Podcast: https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-engadget-podcast/id1142790530?mt=2\nMore about Engadget Audio: https://www.engadget.com/2019-08-01-engadget-podcasts.html \n\nRead more: http://www.engadget.com"},"defaultAudioLanguage":"en"},"contentDetails":{"videoId":"WMfQVQ4YqWw","videoPublishedAt":"2023-03-09T11:00:20Z","duration":"PT8M32S","dimension":"2d","definition":"hd","caption":"false","licensedContent":true,"contentRating":{},"projection":"rectangular"},"status":{"uploadStatus":"processed","privacyStatus":"public","license":"youtube","embeddable":true,"publicStatsViewable":true,"madeForKids":false}},{"kind":"youtube#video","etag":"R7snWhil4wU_IGwfjwS3G5btQKk","id":"3VSm8-imW9I","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2023-03-08T11:00:05Z","channelId":"UC-6OW5aJYBFM33zXQlBKPNA","title":"New foldable and rollable phones at MWC 2023","description":"Of all the news trickling out of Mobile World Congress this year, the most interesting products were either foldables or rollables.
