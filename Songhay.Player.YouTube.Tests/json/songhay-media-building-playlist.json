Within seconds editors and colorists in post production facilities can see media arriving in real time and start editing and grading, even while the camera continues to record. This is a revolution in broadcast workflows where post productions artists can see and work with media, seconds after it's been recorded in a camera, from any location globally.\n\nThe secret to Blackmagic Cloud live sync is the ability of the latest Blackmagic cameras, such as the Cinema Camera 6K, PYXIS, URSA Cine and URSA Broadcast G2, to record a full resolution HD proxy in H.264. These files are live synced to Blackmagic Cloud as they are recorded, and then also live synced down to all DaVinci Resolve workstations that are connected to the same cloud project. All you need to do is connect to the project. It is all automatic!\n\nThe new Blackmagic Cloud live sync feature will be public beta in mid June as a free download for Blackmagic Cinema Camera 6K and Blackmagic URSA Broadcast G2, with updates for all cameras coming shortly after. This update to Blackmagic Cloud will be included free with current Blackmagic Cloud media sync plans. There will be no additional costs.\n\nLive sync on Blackmagic Cloud with cameras recording live into a DaVinci Resolve bin will be demonstrated on the Blackmagic Design Cinegear 2024 booth #S5125.

The degree to which the audio sculpts the end experience here is absolutely wild. \nhttps://www.impossibleacoustic.com\n\nComposited in After Effects, \nAll 3d work in Blender (blender.org)\n\nHuge thanks again, to everyone :D"},"defaultAudioLanguage":"en-US"},"contentDetails":{"videoId":"LsGZ_2RuJ2A","videoPublishedAt":"2021-05-26T06:10:29Z","duration":"PT21M32S","dimension":"2d","definition":"hd","caption":"true","licensedContent":false,"contentRating":{},"projection":"rectangular"},"status":{"uploadStatus":"processed","privacyStatus":"public","license":"youtube","embeddable":true,"publicStatsViewable":true,"madeForKids":false}},{"kind":"youtube#video","etag":"acKo74jOWgL07m8X3kbCkseeCmw","id":"AqA71cWs1WA","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2021-04-23T03:30:22Z","channelId":"UCbmxZRQk-X0p-TOxd6PEYJA","title":"HyperBole!

It will let Daz Studio push the surface of an object outwards along the normals.

Standardized rights statements help increase access and reuse of your items.

Want to learn how to apply them to your digital collection?\n\nJoin the DPLA Rights Statements Working Group for an introduction to standardized rights statements.

This analysis will help both new and seasoned Blender users understand the strengths and limitations of each engine, guiding you in choosing the right tool for your specific needs in Blender 4.2.\n\n#blender #blendertutorial #blender3d"},"defaultAudioLanguage":"en"},"contentDetails":{"videoId":"K8Gc5ys5Ba8","videoPublishedAt":"2024-07-09T05:00:21Z","duration":"PT12M4S","dimension":"2d","definition":"hd","caption":"false","licensedContent":true,"contentRating":{},"projection":"rectangular"},"status":{"uploadStatus":"processed","privacyStatus":"public","license":"youtube","embeddable":true,"publicStatsViewable":true,"madeForKids":false}},{"kind":"youtube#video","etag":"sZZ1PLCwPcpONUVId9earuw_WSY","id":"2GSs0b_yI9M","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2024-07-05T16:05:28Z","channelId":"UCOWrbryuVEPUMSSgayuLURg","title":"#Animate twice as fast in #blender3d with this tool #tip","description":"","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2GSs0b_yI9M/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2GSs0b_yI9M/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2GSs0b_yI9M/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2GSs0b_yI9M/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2GSs0b_yI9M/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"SouthernShotty","playlistId":"UUOWrbryuVEPUMSSgayuLURg","position":2,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"2GSs0b_yI9M"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"SouthernShotty","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCOWrbryuVEPUMSSgayuLURg","categoryId":"27","liveBroadcastContent":"none","localized":{"title":"#Animate twice as fast in #blender3d with this tool #tip","description":""},"defaultAudioLanguage":"en"},"contentDetails":{"videoId":"2GSs0b_yI9M","videoPublishedAt":"2024-07-05T16:05:28Z","duration":"PT41S","dimension":"2d","definition":"hd","caption":"false","licensedContent":true,"contentRating":{},"projection":"rectangular"},"status":{"uploadStatus":"processed","privacyStatus":"public","license":"youtube","embeddable":true,"publicStatsViewable":true,"madeForKids":false}},{"kind":"youtube#video","etag":"tj4DDgjisGfFrLFGuNwSmxI3aps","id":"MSL0W4V3pOQ","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2024-07-02T13:30:11Z","channelId":"UCOWrbryuVEPUMSSgayuLURg","title":"How to Rig Any Car in 10 Minutes without Addons | Blender 3D","description":"Check out PolyCam now and try out a free trial here: https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1532482376?pt=122128498&ct=SouthernShotty&mt=8\n\nPoint Cloud Channel: https://www.youtube.com/@mv_nyc\n\nFree Car Model: https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/low-poly-car-classic-coupe-c90aef909b794a62ae8379fcd7ae4134\n\nFree Eye Texture: https://www.patreon.com/posts/106689306?pr=true\n\nGet ready to turbocharge your 3D car animations!

I'll share my insights from Cohort 9 of the Visual Thinking Workshop, where we explored the book through illustrations. Despite finding the book disorganized and occasionally off-putting with its references to \"the universe,\" I delve into its core ideas about creativity. Rubin emphasizes that everyone is a creator, and creativity isn't confined to traditional art forms. He talks about \"The Source\" of inspiration, the importance of filtering and curating ideas, planting creative seeds, experimenting, crafting, and ultimately completing and sharing one's work.

I'll share my insights from Cohort 9 of the Visual Thinking Workshop, where we explored the book through illustrations. Despite finding the book disorganized and occasionally off-putting with its references to \"the universe,\" I delve into its core ideas about creativity. Rubin emphasizes that everyone is a creator, and creativity isn't confined to traditional art forms. He talks about \"The Source\" of inspiration, the importance of filtering and curating ideas, planting creative seeds, experimenting, crafting, and ultimately completing and sharing one's work.

Unlike speed reading, my method involves immersing myself in a book over 6-8 weeks, blending research, illustration, and deep thinking.\n\nI start by engaging with the book before reading it, often by listening to interviews with the author. This initial step helps me map out the primary ideas and establish context. As I read, I import my highlights into Obsidian, creating a new file for each chapter to keep my notes organized and maintain context. I then review and illustrate each section, integrating these visuals into my notes.\n\nTo enhance my understanding and connections, I use Nick Milo's NoMa method and Vicky Zhao's Idea Compass, mapping ideas spatially in ExcaliBrain. This approach keeps me in constant dialogue with the material, deepening my insights and connections to existing notes.\n\nFinally, I compile these visuals into a cohesive Book-on-a-Page summary, reflecting my personal journey with the book and its integration into my broader knowledge base. This method, while time-intensive, offers rich and engaging insights.\n\nIf you're interested in a deeper, more meaningful reading experience, I encourage you to try this method.

Part 1 explores the web of primary, secondary, and tertiary impacts that stem from the decision to quit a nine-to-five job. Using Excalidraw in Obsidian, we dive into the possible emotional, financial, and social consequences that could unfold months and years down the line.
