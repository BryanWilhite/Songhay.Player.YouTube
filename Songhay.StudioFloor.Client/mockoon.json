Vlad shares his journey from a failed microservices project to his deep dive into the principles of coupling, drawing insights from a 1970s structured design book.\\n\\nThe duo discusses the timeless nature of coupling in software, how modern systems like microservices and cloud architectures still rely on age-old design principles, and the importance of understanding complexity for better problem decomposition and estimation.

Vlad shares his journey from a failed microservices project to his deep dive into the principles of coupling, drawing insights from a 1970s structured design book.\\n\\nThe duo discusses the timeless nature of coupling in software, how modern systems like microservices and cloud architectures still rely on age-old design principles, and the importance of understanding complexity for better problem decomposition and estimation. Vlad also reveals his unique approach to the book\\u2014integrating AI-generated poetry into each chapter to help readers grasp complex concepts. With a focus on modularity as the antidote to complexity, Vlad emphasizes that by managing coupling, engineers can create more maintainable, scalable systems.\\n\\nRECOMMENDED BOOKS\\nVlad Khononov \\u2022 Balancing Coupling in Software Design\\n (https://amzn.to/4iGpbDv) Vlad Khononov \\u2022 Learning Domain-Driven Design\\n (https://amzn.to/41EVhIX) Sheen Brisals \\u0026 Luke Hedger \\u2022 Serverless Development on AWS\\n (https://amzn.to/3W3Sw2f) Glenford Myers \\u2022 Composite/Structured Design\\n (https://amzn.to/4kVblPN) Vaughn Vernon \\u2022 Implementing Domain-Driven Design\\n (https://amzn.to/41Mpk2E) Eric Evans \\u2022 Domain-Driven Design\\n (https://amzn.to/43lNxhv) van Kelle, Verschatse \\u0026 Baas-Schwegler \\u2022 Collaborative Software Design\\n (https://amzn.to/4iv0N8I) Nick Tune \\u0026 Jean-Georges Perrin \\u2022 Architecture Moderniza (https://amzn.to/4b5ASiN) \\n\\n\\nBluesky (https://bsky.app/profile/gotocon.com) \\nTwitter (https://twitter.com/GOTOcon) \\nInstagram (https://www.instagram.com/goto_con) \\nLinkedIn (https://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-) \\nFacebook (https://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences) \\n\\nCHANNEL MEMBERSHIP BONUS\\nJoin this channel to get early access to videos \\u0026 other perks:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs_tLP3AiwYKwdUHpltJPuA/join\\n\\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\\nAttend the next GOTO conference near you!

And 2 of these glorified initiatives are the ONDC and OCEN initiative!!!\\nThese 2 initiatives have failed so badly that ONDC's app is worse than a college student’s first-year project and OCEN has been ignored by the biggest banking players of the country!!\\nAnd the reason why we are making a video on this failure is because 2 years ago, we ourselves made a video on how revolutionary this initiative was!!!

And 2 of these glorified initiatives are the ONDC and OCEN initiative!!!\\nThese 2 initiatives have failed so badly that ONDC's app is worse than a college student’s first-year project and OCEN has been ignored by the biggest banking players of the country!!\\nAnd the reason why we are making a video on this failure is because 2 years ago, we ourselves made a video on how revolutionary this initiative was!!! And one wise comment said, that I wish all the initiatives mentioned in this channel actually get executed but sadly they are just announcements with no action!! So we have decided that we will not just make a video when there is a sensational announcement but also follow up on the action so that we can help you differentiate between marketing and action!! So in this episode today,\\nLet’s try to understand,\\nWhere are the biggest gaps in UPI?\\nWhy are ONDC and OCEN slowing down?\\nAnd what are the lessons that we need to learn from this slowdown of ONDC and OCEN!!\\n\\nAs few of you have asked for the CashBook app link in comment, here it is: \\nhttps://cbook.page.link/think\\n\\n\\n\\n✅Study Materials:\\n\\nhttps://www.dataforindia.com/access-to-banking/#:~:text=There%20are%20now%20nearly%202.5,more%20bank%20accounts%20than%20women.\\n\\nhttps://www.financialexpress.com/business/sme-aditya-birla-finance-joins-ocen-for-loans-to-msmes-on-gem-sahay-3240040/\\n\\nhttps://m.economictimes.com/tech/technology/gem-sahay-lenders-seeking-platforms-repayment-support/articleshow/114918082.cms#:~:text=This%20pilot%20project%20aims%20to,is%20as%20of%20January%202024.\\n\\nhttps://retail.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/e-commerce/e-tailing/gem-sahay-lenders-are-seeking-repayment-support-from-portal/114935405\\n\\nhttps://www.investopedia.com/articles/financial-advisors/021216/top-problems-financial-data-aggregation.asp#:~:text=Banks%20have%20typically%20been%20hesitant%20at%20sharing%20client%20data%20with%20third%2Dparty%20fintech%20firms%20and%20financial%20aggregators%20due%20to%20privacy%20concerns.\\n\\nhttps://yourstory.com/2025/02/phonepe-exits-account-aggregator-business-embracing-partnership-aa#:~:text=Given%20competing%20priorities%2C%20we%20have%20decided%20to%20exit%20the%20business%20and%20instead%20partner%20with%20other%20AAs%20in%20the%20market.\\n\\nhttps://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/technology/gem-sahay-lenders-seeking-platforms-repayment-support/articleshow/114918082.cms?from=mdr#:~:text=GeM%20Sahay%201.0%20has%20been%20discontinued\\n\\n\\nThink School is a Digital School that we all deserved, but never had\\n►►Check out Think School's Online courses: https://www.thethinkschool.com\\n\\n\\n\\n#thinkschool #businesscasestudy #geopolitics\\n\\nCredits: CNN-News 18, WION, NBC News, Money control pro, Business standard, TV18,Business Today, ABC news, CNBC, ET now ,Bloomberg originals, Financial Times, DW documentary, AL Jazeera English, BBC news, Firstpost.\"\n            },\n            \"defaultAudioLanguage\": \"en\"\n          },\n          \"contentDetails\": {\n            \"duration\": \"PT17M43S\",\n            \"dimension\": \"2d\",\n            \"definition\": \"hd\",\n            \"caption\": \"false\",\n            \"licensedContent\": true,\n            \"contentRating\": {},\n            \"projection\": \"rectangular\"\n          },\n          \"status\": {\n            \"uploadStatus\": \"processed\",\n            \"privacyStatus\": \"public\",\n            \"license\": \"youtube\",\n            \"embeddable\": true,\n            \"publicStatsViewable\": true,\n            \"madeForKids\": false\n          }\n        },\n        {\n          \"kind\": \"youtube#video\",\n          \"etag\": \"J5v_L-EEERZGas8zaYh65E5x-5s\",\n          \"id\": \"wVXAFlueS9Y\",\n          \"snippet\": {\n            \"publishedAt\": \"2025-04-11T14:45:07Z\",\n            \"channelId\": \"UCKZozRVHRYsYHGEyNKuhhdA\",\n            \"title\": \"How Steve Jobs saved Apple from BANKRUPTCY? | Documentary | The Greatest Comeback story ever\",\n            \"description\": \"Check out odoo: https://www.odoo.com/r/BUZM \\n\\n⭐️ Think School’s flagship Communication course with live doubt sessions :\\nhttps://thethinkschool.com/sp/communication-masterclass/\\n\\nVIDEO INTRODUCTION:\\n\\nThe year is 1997, and Apple is dying!!!\\n12 years ago Apple was known as a company that put a dent in the universe but now the condition of Apple is so bad that Apple’s market value dropped 80% between early 1992 and the end of 1997., investors have lost hope, their computers are collecting dust at retailers, employees were abandoning apple and nobody wanted to buy an Apple computer!!! \\nA company that was once known as a pioneer in computers was now drowning in debt, and it's bleeding with more than billions of dollars of losses in 1997!!!\\n\\nBut but but, just when apple was about to go bankrupt..something happened.\\none man came back, The man who created Apple.
