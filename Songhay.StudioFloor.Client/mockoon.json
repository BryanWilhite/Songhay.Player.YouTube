Vlad shares his journey from a failed microservices project to his deep dive into the principles of coupling, drawing insights from a 1970s structured design book.\\n\\nThe duo discusses the timeless nature of coupling in software, how modern systems like microservices and cloud architectures still rely on age-old design principles, and the importance of understanding complexity for better problem decomposition and estimation.

Vlad shares his journey from a failed microservices project to his deep dive into the principles of coupling, drawing insights from a 1970s structured design book.\\n\\nThe duo discusses the timeless nature of coupling in software, how modern systems like microservices and cloud architectures still rely on age-old design principles, and the importance of understanding complexity for better problem decomposition and estimation. Vlad also reveals his unique approach to the book\\u2014integrating AI-generated poetry into each chapter to help readers grasp complex concepts. With a focus on modularity as the antidote to complexity, Vlad emphasizes that by managing coupling, engineers can create more maintainable, scalable systems.\\n\\nRECOMMENDED BOOKS\\nVlad Khononov \\u2022 Balancing Coupling in Software Design\\n (https://amzn.to/4iGpbDv) Vlad Khononov \\u2022 Learning Domain-Driven Design\\n (https://amzn.to/41EVhIX) Sheen Brisals \\u0026 Luke Hedger \\u2022 Serverless Development on AWS\\n (https://amzn.to/3W3Sw2f) Glenford Myers \\u2022 Composite/Structured Design\\n (https://amzn.to/4kVblPN) Vaughn Vernon \\u2022 Implementing Domain-Driven Design\\n (https://amzn.to/41Mpk2E) Eric Evans \\u2022 Domain-Driven Design\\n (https://amzn.to/43lNxhv) van Kelle, Verschatse \\u0026 Baas-Schwegler \\u2022 Collaborative Software Design\\n (https://amzn.to/4iv0N8I) Nick Tune \\u0026 Jean-Georges Perrin \\u2022 Architecture Moderniza (https://amzn.to/4b5ASiN) \\n\\n\\nBluesky (https://bsky.app/profile/gotocon.com) \\nTwitter (https://twitter.com/GOTOcon) \\nInstagram (https://www.instagram.com/goto_con) \\nLinkedIn (https://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-) \\nFacebook (https://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences) \\n\\nCHANNEL MEMBERSHIP BONUS\\nJoin this channel to get early access to videos \\u0026 other perks:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs_tLP3AiwYKwdUHpltJPuA/join\\n\\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\\nAttend the next GOTO conference near you!

And 2 of these glorified initiatives are the ONDC and OCEN initiative!!!\\nThese 2 initiatives have failed so badly that ONDC's app is worse than a college student’s first-year project and OCEN has been ignored by the biggest banking players of the country!!\\nAnd the reason why we are making a video on this failure is because 2 years ago, we ourselves made a video on how revolutionary this initiative was!!!

And 2 of these glorified initiatives are the ONDC and OCEN initiative!!!\\nThese 2 initiatives have failed so badly that ONDC's app is worse than a college student’s first-year project and OCEN has been ignored by the biggest banking players of the country!!\\nAnd the reason why we are making a video on this failure is because 2 years ago, we ourselves made a video on how revolutionary this initiative was!!! And one wise comment said, that I wish all the initiatives mentioned in this channel actually get executed but sadly they are just announcements with no action!! So we have decided that we will not just make a video when there is a sensational announcement but also follow up on the action so that we can help you differentiate between marketing and action!! So in this episode today,\\nLet’s try to understand,\\nWhere are the biggest gaps in UPI?\\nWhy are ONDC and OCEN slowing down?\\nAnd what are the lessons that we need to learn from this slowdown of ONDC and OCEN!!\\n\\nAs few of you have asked for the CashBook app link in comment, here it is: \\nhttps://cbook.page.link/think\\n\\n\\n\\n✅Study Materials:\\n\\nhttps://www.dataforindia.com/access-to-banking/#:~:text=There%20are%20now%20nearly%202.5,more%20bank%20accounts%20than%20women.\\n\\nhttps://www.financialexpress.com/business/sme-aditya-birla-finance-joins-ocen-for-loans-to-msmes-on-gem-sahay-3240040/\\n\\nhttps://m.economictimes.com/tech/technology/gem-sahay-lenders-seeking-platforms-repayment-support/articleshow/114918082.cms#:~:text=This%20pilot%20project%20aims%20to,is%20as%20of%20January%202024.\\n\\nhttps://retail.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/e-commerce/e-tailing/gem-sahay-lenders-are-seeking-repayment-support-from-portal/114935405\\n\\nhttps://www.investopedia.com/articles/financial-advisors/021216/top-problems-financial-data-aggregation.asp#:~:text=Banks%20have%20typically%20been%20hesitant%20at%20sharing%20client%20data%20with%20third%2Dparty%20fintech%20firms%20and%20financial%20aggregators%20due%20to%20privacy%20concerns.\\n\\nhttps://yourstory.com/2025/02/phonepe-exits-account-aggregator-business-embracing-partnership-aa#:~:text=Given%20competing%20priorities%2C%20we%20have%20decided%20to%20exit%20the%20business%20and%20instead%20partner%20with%20other%20AAs%20in%20the%20market.\\n\\nhttps://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/technology/gem-sahay-lenders-seeking-platforms-repayment-support/articleshow/114918082.cms?from=mdr#:~:text=GeM%20Sahay%201.0%20has%20been%20discontinued\\n\\n\\nThink School is a Digital School that we all deserved, but never had\\n►►Check out Think School's Online courses: https://www.thethinkschool.com\\n\\n\\n\\n#thinkschool #businesscasestudy #geopolitics\\n\\nCredits: CNN-News 18, WION, NBC News, Money control pro, Business standard, TV18,Business Today, ABC news, CNBC, ET now ,Bloomberg originals, Financial Times, DW documentary, AL Jazeera English, BBC news, Firstpost.\"\n            },\n            \"defaultAudioLanguage\": \"en\"\n          },\n          \"contentDetails\": {\n            \"duration\": \"PT17M43S\",\n            \"dimension\": \"2d\",\n            \"definition\": \"hd\",\n            \"caption\": \"false\",\n            \"licensedContent\": true,\n            \"contentRating\": {},\n            \"projection\": \"rectangular\"\n          },\n          \"status\": {\n            \"uploadStatus\": \"processed\",\n            \"privacyStatus\": \"public\",\n            \"license\": \"youtube\",\n            \"embeddable\": true,\n            \"publicStatsViewable\": true,\n            \"madeForKids\": false\n          }\n        },\n        {\n          \"kind\": \"youtube#video\",\n          \"etag\": \"J5v_L-EEERZGas8zaYh65E5x-5s\",\n          \"id\": \"wVXAFlueS9Y\",\n          \"snippet\": {\n            \"publishedAt\": \"2025-04-11T14:45:07Z\",\n            \"channelId\": \"UCKZozRVHRYsYHGEyNKuhhdA\",\n            \"title\": \"How Steve Jobs saved Apple from BANKRUPTCY? | Documentary | The Greatest Comeback story ever\",\n            \"description\": \"Check out odoo: https://www.odoo.com/r/BUZM \\n\\n⭐️ Think School’s flagship Communication course with live doubt sessions :\\nhttps://thethinkschool.com/sp/communication-masterclass/\\n\\nVIDEO INTRODUCTION:\\n\\nThe year is 1997, and Apple is dying!!!\\n12 years ago Apple was known as a company that put a dent in the universe but now the condition of Apple is so bad that Apple’s market value dropped 80% between early 1992 and the end of 1997., investors have lost hope, their computers are collecting dust at retailers, employees were abandoning apple and nobody wanted to buy an Apple computer!!! \\nA company that was once known as a pioneer in computers was now drowning in debt, and it's bleeding with more than billions of dollars of losses in 1997!!!\\n\\nBut but but, just when apple was about to go bankrupt..something happened.\\none man came back, The man who created Apple.

that don’t win the League | BBC News\",\n            \"description\": \"In an exclusive interview with BBC Sports Editor Dan Roan, Liverpool’s head coach Arne Slot has said that excuses are \\\"for teams that don't win the league\\\" and it is \\\"nice\\\" his side won the Premier League so he does not have to rely on them.\\n\\nReflecting on leading the club to a 20th top-flight title in his first year since succeeding Jurgen Klopp, the Dutchman told BBC Sport of his pride at the achievement, despite some challenges.\\n\\nHe said:  “All these excuses you could give to Liverpool... with us maybe not spending... or not bringing new players in, or taking over from someone.... All these things are excuses for teams that don't win the league, and it's nice that if you have all these excuses, that you don't have to use them, but you still just won it.\\\"\\n\\nLiverpool secured the title without any serious strengthening of the squad Slot inherited, which he said made it \\\"probably even more special\\\".  And he drew comparisons with his time at Feyenoord, where he won the Eredivisie in 2023 despite an overhaul of his team.  \\\"I did it now in two different leagues and in two different ways.”\\n\\nRecently the Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta lamented how “red cards and injuries” had impacted on his team’s title bid.   Last season’s Premier League winners Manchester City cited similar problems with injuries to key players for the club’s failure to present a sustained challenge to Liverpool.\\n\\nIn a wide-ranging interview conducted at the club's training ground before Liverpool's final match of the season against Crystal Palace on Sunday, Slot also spoke of his \\\"hope” that Trent Alexander-Arnold gets a \\\"positive\\\" send-off, after he was booed by some fans following confirmation he will leave his boyhood club next month.\\n\\nSlot also said he would\\\"cherish for the rest of my life\\\" his team’s open bus parade through Liverpool to celebrate winning the title.\\n\\nHe disputed Arteta's argument that teams had to be in \\\"the right place at the right time\\\" to win the Premier League, suggesting that over a long and arduous season it was clear that the best team won.\\n\\nHe insisted he was \\\"not worried\\\" about the uncertainty that surrounded key players Mohamed Salah and Virgil van Dijk before they signed contract extensions and said it would be \\\"stupid\\\" not to strengthen the squad this summer, although he admitted that the club may not be able to bring in the players they most want.\\n\\nJane Hill presents Arne Slot’s exclusive interview with BBC Sports Editor Dan Roan.\\n\\nWATCH THE FULL INTERVIEW ON BBC

are for teams that don’t win the League | BBC News\",\n              \"description\": \"In an exclusive interview with BBC Sports Editor Dan Roan, Liverpool’s head coach Arne Slot has said that excuses are \\\"for teams that don't win the league\\\" and it is \\\"nice\\\" his side won the Premier League so he does not have to rely on them.\\n\\nReflecting on leading the club to a 20th top-flight title in his first year since succeeding Jurgen Klopp, the Dutchman told BBC Sport of his pride at the achievement, despite some challenges.\\n\\nHe said:  “All these excuses you could give to Liverpool... with us maybe not spending... or not bringing new players in, or taking over from someone.... All these things are excuses for teams that don't win the league, and it's nice that if you have all these excuses, that you don't have to use them, but you still just won it.\\\"\\n\\nLiverpool secured the title without any serious strengthening of the squad Slot inherited, which he said made it \\\"probably even more special\\\".  And he drew comparisons with his time at Feyenoord, where he won the Eredivisie in 2023 despite an overhaul of his team.  \\\"I did it now in two different leagues and in two different ways.”\\n\\nRecently the Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta lamented how “red cards and injuries” had impacted on his team’s title bid.   Last season’s Premier League winners Manchester City cited similar problems with injuries to key players for the club’s failure to present a sustained challenge to Liverpool.\\n\\nIn a wide-ranging interview conducted at the club's training ground before Liverpool's final match of the season against Crystal Palace on Sunday, Slot also spoke of his \\\"hope” that Trent Alexander-Arnold gets a \\\"positive\\\" send-off, after he was booed by some fans following confirmation he will leave his boyhood club next month.\\n\\nSlot also said he would\\\"cherish for the rest of my life\\\" his team’s open bus parade through Liverpool to celebrate winning the title.\\n\\nHe disputed Arteta's argument that teams had to be in \\\"the right place at the right time\\\" to win the Premier League, suggesting that over a long and arduous season it was clear that the best team won.\\n\\nHe insisted he was \\\"not worried\\\" about the uncertainty that surrounded key players Mohamed Salah and Virgil van Dijk before they signed contract extensions and said it would be \\\"stupid\\\" not to strengthen the squad this summer, although he admitted that the club may not be able to bring in the players they most want.\\n\\nJane Hill presents Arne Slot’s exclusive interview with BBC Sports Editor Dan Roan.\\n\\nWATCH THE FULL INTERVIEW ON BBC iPLAYER:\\nhttps://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/p0lcd7bv/premier-league-arne-slot-reflects-on-title-signings-and-partying-in-ibiza\\n\\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\\n\\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \\n\\n#BBCNews\"\n            },\n            \"defaultAudioLanguage\": \"en-GB\"\n          },\n          \"contentDetails\": {\n            \"duration\": \"PT2M50S\",\n            \"dimension\": \"2d\",\n            \"definition\": \"hd\",\n            \"caption\": \"false\",\n            \"licensedContent\": true,\n            \"contentRating\": {},\n            \"projection\": \"rectangular\"\n          },\n          \"status\": {\n            \"uploadStatus\": \"processed\",\n            \"privacyStatus\": \"public\",\n            \"license\": \"youtube\",\n            \"embeddable\": true,\n            \"publicStatsViewable\": false,\n            \"madeForKids\": false\n          }\n        },\n        {\n          \"kind\": \"youtube#video\",\n          \"etag\": \"SeCfjf5cIWh9k9sbgnW_0EjEc-U\",\n          \"id\": \"bWsjI9VrDrA\",\n          \"snippet\": {\n            \"publishedAt\": \"2025-05-23T18:00:38Z\",\n            \"channelId\": \"UC16niRr50-MSBwiO3YDb3RA\",\n            \"title\": \"Why has migration to the UK dramatically fallen in the last year? | BBC Newscast\",\n            \"description\": \"The UK government are claiming credit for a fall in migration numbers - but should they?

Chief among the reasons is a shift to Monthly Quad 2 - when growth and inflation are accelerating at the same time.\\n\\n\\\"The only quad that Bitcoin backtests really poorly in is Quad 4 [when growth and inflation slow together],\\\" Steiner explains. \\\"The best is in Quad 3 [when growth slows, but inflation accelerates]. And interestingly we have a May Quad 3 and a June Quad 2.\\\" \\n\\nSteiner also highlights Hedgeye’s current Bullish trend signal on Bitcoin, noting that the cryptocurrency is in a pivotal stage of its quadrennial halving cycle—a period that has historically marked some of its most explosive return phases.\\n\\nMake no mistake, Hedgeye views Bitcoin as just another asset to be bought and sold in the appropriate economic environments.

Chief among the reasons is a shift to Monthly Quad 2 - when growth and inflation are accelerating at the same time.\\n\\n\\\"The only quad that Bitcoin backtests really poorly in is Quad 4 [when growth and inflation slow together],\\\" Steiner explains. \\\"The best is in Quad 3 [when growth slows, but inflation accelerates]. And interestingly we have a May Quad 3 and a June Quad 2.\\\" \\n\\nSteiner also highlights Hedgeye’s current Bullish trend signal on Bitcoin, noting that the cryptocurrency is in a pivotal stage of its quadrennial halving cycle—a period that has historically marked some of its most explosive return phases.\\n\\nMake no mistake, Hedgeye views Bitcoin as just another asset to be bought and sold in the appropriate economic environments. We don't blindly hold it in perpetuity - we buy it when it's appropriate and short it when the data tells us to.\\n\\nHedgeye CEO Keith McCullough then summarizes the three reasons to buy Bitcoin: \\\"The [bullish] signal says buy it.

Dangers\",\n            \"description\": \"Car Industry: Emission Fraud - ‘Dieselgate’ made headlines around the world. For deliberately cheating the system, Volkswagen were made to pay a record $20 billion fine. But, as this investigation shows, they were far from the only culprits. We met the researchers who uncovered the cheat devise and investigate the dangers posed by NOx emissions.\\n\\nCar Industry: Emission Fraud (2017)\\nDirector: Jules Giraudat\\nGenre: Documentary\\nCountry: France\\nLanguage: English\\nAlso Known As: Cash Investigation: Diesel, The Industry's Smokescreen\\n\\nSynopsis:\\nWe also look at Peugeot-Citroen, now the subject of a judicial enquiry and also Renault, accused by investigators of consciously defrauding the emissions tests. Our source from inside Renault reveals that his job was to ensure that the car’s emissions stayed under the standard while in lab conditions only, with no regard for the real impact of pollution in cities. And there is no doubt that air pollution kills. We meet a team of researchers from MIT who say there have been 4000 premature deaths across Europe due to NOx excessive emissions due to diesel cars marketed as ‘clean’.\\n\\nThirty people in France are now taking the state to court for not protecting them. Ministers claim that no-one knew about the problem until recently. But we reveal the truth. We meet the ex-European Commissioner for the Environment who first raised this issue in 2011 long before the VW scandal. And surely now that the scandal has been revealed, things will change for the better? Recently in Europe all 27 member states voted to increase the allowed standard for NOx emissions to more than double. VW and Renault are having a great year with record sales and growth.

For deliberately cheating the system, Volkswagen were made to pay a record $20 billion fine. But, as this investigation shows, they were far from the only culprits. We met the researchers who uncovered the cheat devise and investigate the dangers posed by NOx emissions.\\n\\nCar Industry: Emission Fraud (2017)\\nDirector: Jules Giraudat\\nGenre: Documentary\\nCountry: France\\nLanguage: English\\nAlso Known As: Cash Investigation: Diesel, The Industry's Smokescreen\\n\\nSynopsis:\\nWe also look at Peugeot-Citroen, now the subject of a judicial enquiry and also Renault, accused by investigators of consciously defrauding the emissions tests. Our source from inside Renault reveals that his job was to ensure that the car’s emissions stayed under the standard while in lab conditions only, with no regard for the real impact of pollution in cities. And there is no doubt that air pollution kills. We meet a team of researchers from MIT who say there have been 4000 premature deaths across Europe due to NOx excessive emissions due to diesel cars marketed as ‘clean’.\\n\\nThirty people in France are now taking the state to court for not protecting them. Ministers claim that no-one knew about the problem until recently. But we reveal the truth. We meet the ex-European Commissioner for the Environment who first raised this issue in 2011 long before the VW scandal. And surely now that the scandal has been revealed, things will change for the better? Recently in Europe all 27 member states voted to increase the allowed standard for NOx emissions to more than double. VW and Renault are having a great year with record sales and growth. The only real losers are children living in cities and people with asthma and breathing difficulties.\\n\\nSUPPORT US!\\n✘ Membership - https://bit.ly/3q5XPBh\\n\\nMORE DOCS!\\n► Gold: https://bit.ly/2IRZ0OA\\n► World Economy: https://bit.ly/36QlhEM\\n► All Playlists: https://bit.ly/3lOiCll\\n\\n#finance #documentaries #economy\\n\\nCOPYRIGHT: All of the films published by us are legally licensed.

With the advancing digitalization in the 21st century, this process has accelerated rapidly and opened up new opportunities to think about finance differently.
