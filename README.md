## Bolero Components, Elmish types and JSON handlers for  b-roll player for YouTube ðŸŽ¥ content

**NuGet package ðŸ“¦:** [`Songhay.Player.YouTube`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Songhay.Player.YouTube)

These are the main concerns of this work:

- Models of [YouTube API](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/) JSON shapes
- Elmish types for [Bolero](https://github.com/fsbolero/bolero)
- JSON parser utilities to obtain Models of the YouTube API
- Bolero Components for the b-roll player YouTube experience

## SCSS file drama

The `*.scss` files in the `Songhay.Player.YouTube/src/scss` [directory](./Songhay.Player.YouTube/src/scss) must be included with the `Songhay.Player.YouTube` NuGet [package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Songhay.Player.YouTube). I will eventually discover the cool-kidsâ€™ way of packaging these files such that the package consumer will have them where _they_ want them.
